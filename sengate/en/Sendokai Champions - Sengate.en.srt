1
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,036
Lon!

2
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:26,555
Lon… Wake up…

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,669
Ship’s log:

4
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:39,035
After all these years,
finally, it’s time.

5
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:41,672
You know what you need to do.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,459
I have to get hold of
the Map of the Hakuru…

7
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,206
but Zak will never allow it.

8
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:01,215
You are the Great Zorn!
Get up!

9
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,771
I need Cloe’s help…

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,723
You do not need anyone!
Follow the plan...

11
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,910
and you’ll have more power
than you ever imagined!

12
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:24,000
I will be with you.

13
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,920
I’ll never suffer again.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,316
I’ll never have to be alone.

15
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:51,608
The multiverse will be at my feet!

16
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:04,902
Lon!

17
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,785
Zak!

18
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,364
Cloe!

19
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,584
Am I dreaming?

20
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:41,369
Or was that a giant Zorn Meka
kidnapping Cloe?

21
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:44,636
Kiet! Fenzy!

22
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,409
Zak!

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,680
What’s going on?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,644
Did you throw a Zorn party
without inviting us?

25
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,160
It's Lon! And he’s got Cloe!

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,444
I told you this “dating” thing
would end in tears!

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,417
Let's get to the hill!

28
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,239
Wait! The ships are moving!

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
We’ve got to get to the hill!

30
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,822
Didn't I just say that?

31
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,834
Human "Cloe,"
welcome to your suite.

32
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:20,639
Suite?

33
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,818
This isn’t a hotel,
it’s a prison!

34
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,786
The Great Zorn wishes you
a pleasant stay.

35
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,796
Hey, wait!
Let me out of here!

36
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:33,886
What the... ?

37
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,920
A map of the ship…

38
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,124
And a route leading me to another room…

39
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,322
But how do I get out?

40
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:49,305
OK...

41
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:52,428
Now I just need a source of Sen energy.

42
00:03:55,499 --> 00:04:01,770
Someone wants to play games.
Then let’s play!

43
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,552
SEN-DO-KAI!

44
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,660
Buckle up, Lon! I’m gonna…

45
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,470
Bye-bye, Cloe.

46
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,630
Now what?

47
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,105
Zak? Can you hear me?

48
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:29,055
Cloe! Are you OK?
What’s going on?

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
I’m fine, I’m fine! But listen…

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,803
Someone on the ship
is helping me!

51
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:35,583
What?

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,540
It’s a trap! It's gotta be!

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,513
I have to find out what’s happening.

54
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:43,200
You’re on board a Zorn warship!

55
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,739
It’s too dangerous!

56
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:48,228
We already took out
one of those hunks o' junk.

57
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:51,631
They have a weak spot!
The Sen storage tanks.

58
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,748
Yeah, if we hit the generator…

59
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:57,240
we can cut off
the whole ship’s energy supply!

60
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:00,920
But how do we find the ship?

61
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,350
With the map of the Hakuru!

62
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,561
If we know where Cloe is,
we know where the ship is.

63
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:12,993
Gotcha!

64
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,270
Great!

65
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,000
I’m going to solve this mystery!

66
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,443
We’ll cut off the energy supply!

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,120
And then I’ll deal with Lon…

68
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,044
Follow me!

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,837
Hang in there, Cloe!

70
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,647
We're coming!

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,743
We’re going in through those doors.

72
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,387
Cover me and I’ll blast ‘em wide!

73
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,400
Zap!

74
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,563
Oh wow, amazing plan.

75
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,339
OK, Miss Negativity,
anything constructive to add?

76
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,225
Yeah: why do we always
have to do what you say?

77
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,025
Because I am the Hakuru!

78
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,222
Humans!

79
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,200
Look out!

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
We gotta strike back!

81
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
But we don't have any dös!

82
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,160
I know where to get some!

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,220
Cover me!

84
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,842
Koa Sen Shield!

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Tai Sen Trail!

86
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,960
Human guest!
You may not leave your suite!

87
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,925
Worst. Hotel. Ever.

88
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,408
I'll be talking to your manager.

89
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,190
This way…

90
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,963
See, Kiet?
This is what you call style!

91
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:05,835
It’s kinda samey though?
You need some fresh moves.

92
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:15,027
Geo Sen Shockwave!

93
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,516
Ka-boom! Match that!

94
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:30,040
OK, let’s ramp the cooliosity
up to the maximosity!

95
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,011
Zet Sen Shot!

96
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,624
Go Sen Tornado!

97
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:04,916
Yeah!

98
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,618
Bim, bam, boom!
Look at that,

99
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,272
Miss Negativity here
just saved your butt.

100
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:26,413
OK, OK! Let’s get inside!

101
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,120
There it is!

102
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,689
The generator!

103
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,522
Piece of cake!

104
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,160
We are numerically superior.
Please consider surrender.

105
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,880
Sure, we accept: you can surrender!

106
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:07,765
My apologies,
what I intended to say was…

107
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:15,829
OK guys, cover me
and I’ll blast it apart - Zap!

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,644
That’s the same plan as before.
And it still sucks!

109
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:23,361
Leave this to me,
it needs more bim-bam-boom!

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,160
No, no, no.

111
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,307
What it needs is just a little bim...
and then KABOOM!

112
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:31,796
What are you two talking about?

113
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:34,116
There’s only one way to decide this

114
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:37,822
democratically, equitably and fairly…

115
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,550
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

116
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,430
This is it.

117
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,540
Ship’s log: Stardate 210403.

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,569
I have deciphered
the ancient scroll of Beldzar.

119
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:11,768
Danima planted five seeds
of pure Sen energy

120
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:14,384
on five planets
scattered across the multiverse.

121
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,556
I travelled to each planet

122
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:20,314
and found only devastation.

123
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:25,493
Four have been destroyed,
and the Sen seeds stolen…

124
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:28,933
Only one remains - Earth.

125
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:30,938
But they are coming.

126
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:34,098
Beings with the most destructive powers
I have ever seen.

127
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:35,480
The Yitsu.

128
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:40,171
The only hope of defeating them
is the Stardö.

129
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:44,056
To activate it, I need the seed
from planet Earth.

130
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,205
And now, I know where it is hidden

131
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,414
Inside the map of the Hakuru.

132
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:53,338
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

133
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,641
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

134
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:57,082
Zak. I've got something!

135
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:00,316
Lon wants your map,
the map of the Hakuru!

136
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,376
Right! Everybody wants to be the leader!
Why would that idiot be any different?

137
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,175
No, Zak, there's more, and it's bad!

138
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,219
The Yitsu are coming,
to take the Sen seed!

139
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:14,234
The what? The “Yitsu?"
The Sen seed?

140
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,477
Zak? What’s wrong?

141
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,965
Nothing… I’m fine.

142
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:29,347
Cloe! This is all coming
from Lon!

143
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:31,131
You know he’s a liar!

144
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:34,115
Zak, Lon hurt us,
he betrayed us,

145
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,342
but he never lied to us.

146
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:38,721
Thank you for believing in me, Cloe.

147
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:44,320
Lon!

148
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,837
Cloe, are you OK?
Can you hear me? What's happening?

149
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,205
Kiet, Fenzy! The job’s yours!

150
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,978
Don’t let me down!

151
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:02,251
-I’m just going to call dibs.
-Oh man!

152
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:09,640
Yao Sen Vision!

153
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:19,885
Impressive.

154
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:27,478
But the show's over.

155
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,120
Lon! What are you doing?

156
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Let me out of here!
You're a monster!

157
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,794
No. I am the Great Zorn!

158
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:40,789
And when I have activated the Stardö
I will rule the multiverse...

159
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,421
With you at my side!

160
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,990
That’s never going to happen!

161
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,703
And Zak will never give you the map.

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,189
Zak is a fool,

163
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,913
and he will give me the map
because I have the best possible bait.

164
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,536
-You.
-No...

165
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,480
Lon... what happened to you?

166
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,413
I have become more powerful
than you can imagine!

167
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,240
Maybe... but you're still alone.

168
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:24,184
No! What are you doing?!

169
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,634
Nu Sen Flare!

170
00:14:32,507 --> 00:14:34,107
Don’t try anything, Lon!

171
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,208
Cloe... Cloe! It's me!
It was me who helped you escape...

172
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,960
How am I supposed to believe you?
Who are you really?

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,467
The helmet gave me power.
I became the Great Zorn.

174
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,265
But one day everything changed.

175
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,731
I had a dream, and it was so real.
In the dream, there was a message for me:

176
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:07,840
"Find the Stardö."
And Cloe… I found it.

177
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:23,200
-So it's true....
-Yes. When the Stardö is activated

178
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,587
my army will be so powerful
I'll be able to defeat the Yitsu!

179
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,222
But then why kidnap me?

180
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:34,280
I need you to help me,
to convince Zak to give me the map.

181
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:35,791
Why should I trust you?

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,865
There’s one more thing....

183
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:39,995
It was in the message...

184
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:44,209
“Tell Cloe, she chose
the wrong train.”

185
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:56,568
How do you know that?
I never told anyone.

186
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,280
You have to trust me.

187
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,171
Cloe?

188
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,157
What… what’s going on?

189
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,232
Here we go!
Watch and learn, Kiet!

190
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:27,535
Ha! This is how you do it.

191
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,256
Proceed to eliminate them.

192
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,859
Looks like we upset them.

193
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:48,000
We gotta to defend ourselves!

194
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:52,475
No! I’m sick of playing defense.
We need to attack!

195
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:56,960
I’ve got it! Kiet: you and me,
we’ve got a connection, right?

196
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,770
Yeah, sure.

197
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,368
Then let's try something new.

198
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,164
OK! Let's do a…

199
00:17:04,164 --> 00:17:06,164
Duo Sen Force!

200
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:12,300
DUO SEN FORCE!

201
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,429
More power, Fenzy!

202
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,328
Coming up!

203
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:40,187
-Gotcha!
-Check us out!

204
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,565
Uh, when I said we had a connection,
all I meant was...

205
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,150
-No, no, me too, I'm not like...
-Phew!

206
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:53,697
Put it there, Fenzy!

207
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,375
Did we take it up a notch too far?

208
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
What's going on?!

209
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:05,708
Zak, listen...

210
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,327
Cloe! Stand back!

211
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,550
And you - get away from her!

212
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,520
You have to give him the map.

213
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,640
What?

214
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,885
I am the only one who can open it.

215
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:20,125
The power of the Sen seed
would kill any normal human.

216
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,178
A normal human? I'm the Hakuru!

217
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:26,800
If you want my map,
you’ll have to rip it out of my hands!

218
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,788
It would be absurd to fight.
I have an Empire!

219
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,707
That Empire's not looking
too sturdy to me.

220
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:44,606
No!

221
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,250
The generator has failed...
But how?

222
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,587
Kiet? Fenzy? You did it!

223
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,058
Maybe even overdid it!

224
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:56,347
We have to get out of here!
See you outside!

225
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,305
Those guys…

226
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,703
It’s causing a chain reaction
across all systems.

227
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:14,324
The ship's going to explode!

228
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,641
You need to go!
Now!

229
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,920
-But Lon...
-Cloe!

230
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:58,616
You guys!

231
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:02,095
-Over here!
-The ship's going to explode!

232
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,994
Zak!

233
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:31,840
No!

234
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,720
We're going to be squished!

235
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,793
Lon!

236
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,680
You saved us...

237
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:13,641
I saved the map.

238
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,200
“The map of the Hakuru!"
Ha! It is so much more than that…

239
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,360
OK, this is totally insane!

240
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:56,378
The greatest power in the multiverse,
from the beginnings of time,

241
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,872
the Sen seed!

242
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:03,488
Now all I need is the final piece…

243
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,679
It’s the Stardö.

244
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The what now?

245
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,453
At last!

246
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,451
It works!
Now I will be unstoppable!

247
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:37,308
Lon! This isn't you!
Take off the helmet!

248
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:38,588
Never!

249
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,485
This is the pure power of the Sen,
and it's mine!

250
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:46,960
What?

251
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,350
If you won't take off that helmet,
I'm going to do it for you!

252
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,654
I'll crush you!

253
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,373
Not bad,
Zak's got some new moves after all!

254
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,413
Sho... Sen...

255
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,183
Fire!

256
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,490
How's that crushing thing
working for you now?

257
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,083
You fool! All I wanted
was the stupid map!

258
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,040
Now I'm going to have to destroy you.

259
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,880
Ha! It must suck so much to know
you'll never be as cool as me!

260
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,400
You're nobody, and your story ends here.

261
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,940
That’s where you’re wrong, bud!
This is just the beginning!

262
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,649
Zet... Sen... Shot!

263
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,464
Zet... Sen... Shot!

264
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,814
You took everything I had!
But you're not going to take this!

265
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:29,805
The power of the Sen must be mine!

266
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:41,280
You want power, you spoilt little brat?
Here, have some power.

267
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,320
You did it, Zak!

268
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,419
Mission accomplished...

269
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,265
At last, a time out.

270
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,364
I take it back!
What's going on?

271
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,235
The Stardö - it's out of control!

272
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,040
It's going to explode!

273
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,185
Are you guys OK?

274
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,261
I feel like I was hit by a truck.

275
00:28:33,474 --> 00:28:36,000
Our armor, our powers...

276
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,800
It's all gone!

277
00:28:39,506 --> 00:28:41,847
It was the Stardö. Lon!

278
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:45,335
What happened? What do we do now?

279
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,400
It's over.

280
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:56,740
The Yitsu will come. And without my army,
no one can stop them.

281
00:28:57,262 --> 00:28:58,504
I failed.

282
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:03,653
Lon, you didn't fail.
You brought the Stardö.

283
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,306
Ha. You'll never be able to use it.
You don't stand a chance.

284
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:09,851
Good luck, guys.

285
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,935
Lon, you're an arrogant jerk.

286
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,078
And I should know,
because I am one too.

287
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:29,240
I get way too full of myself.

288
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,301
I should listen to my friends.

289
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,387
And sometimes my plans aren't the best.

290
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:40,983
In fact, I have no clue
how we're going to stop the Yitsu.

291
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:44,623
But I know we can do it.
Because we never give up...

292
00:29:44,623 --> 00:29:47,163
...and that's the spirit of Sendokai.

293
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:50,582
Right.

294
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,140
We’ve had our backs against the wall 1000 times,
but we always come through.

295
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:59,355
Yeah! And we always have
a blast along the way.

296
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,352
And we do it all
for the people we care about most.

297
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,176
OK.

298
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:19,436
But just to be clear.
I don't need any motivational speeches.

299
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:25,280
And I don't need your friendship.
But nobody can face this on their own.

300
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:32,047
Remember...
A Sendokai warrior is never alone...

301
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:35,146
...as long as they have a team.

302
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:39,680
Sen-do-kai!

303
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:45,386
Senkuns!
This is only the beginning!

304
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:48,827
Sendokai Champions season 3
is coming soon!

305
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:52,750
And you want to be ready
when it does, right?

306
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,082
So, make sure you subscribe!

307
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:58,764
And in the meantime,
watch the first two seasons!

308
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,499
Absolute cinema.

309
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,720
The Stardö has awoken.
