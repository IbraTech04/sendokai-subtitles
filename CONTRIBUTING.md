# How to Contribute

Ready to help out? Great! Here's how you can get started:

**This repository relies on GitFlow**. If you're not familiar with Git, I recommend you read up on it before contributing. You can find a great guide [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

## Step 1: Claim an Episode

First, check the progress section above to see which episodes are available. If you see an episode that's not claimed, feel free to claim it by creating an `Issue` in this repository. This will let others know that you're working on it, and will prevent others from working on the same episode at the same time (causing merge conflicts). If someone else is working on the episode you want to work on, feel free to reach out to them and see if they need any help!

## Step 2: Acquire the required resources

You'll need to acquire the Spanish version of the episode you're working on. You can do this by downloading the episode from the [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampions) using a tool such as [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

*Note: You are more than welcome to use any other dub to create the subtitles, however do keep in mind that some versions (notably the Arabic dub) omit scenes from the original Spanish version. This can make it difficult to subtitle the episode, as you may not have all the necessary context, and may create incomplete subtitles.*

You'll also need a `.srt` editor. I personally recommend and use [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/), but you can use any `.srt` editor you like.

## Step 3: Clone this repository

You'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, or using the GUI buttons on the GitHub website. If you really wanna get fancy, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone the repository. If you know how to use Git, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone github.com/ibratech04/sendokai-champions-subtitles
```

## Step 4: Subtitle the Episode

Once you're all setup, you can start subtitling the episode! You can do this by opening the `.srt` file for the episode you're working on in your `.srt` editor, loading in the episode, and adding the subtitles. Once you're done, save the file and move onto the next step.

This step will take you the longest, at around 45 minutes to an hour per episode. If you're new to subtitling, it may take you longer. Don't worry, you'll get faster with practice!

If you're stuck, check out the [Subtitling Tips](subtitling-tips.md) document for some tips and tricks on how to subtitle effectively.

## Step 5: Push your changes and create a Pull Request

Once you're done, push your changes to your local repository and create a Pull Request. This will let others know that you're done, and will allow others to review your work. If there are any issues, you can make the necessary changes and push them to the repository. Once your Pull Request is approved, your subtitles will be added to the repository and marked as complete!
