# Sendokai Champions Subtitles 
Welcome to the Sendokai Champions Subtitles project! This repository aims to recreate English subtitles for the animated series "Sendokai Champions" (also known as *Desafio Champions Sendokai*). This open-source repository is a place where fans and volunteers can contribute to making the show accessible to English-speaking audiences.

## Premise 
[Sendokai Champions](http://www.sendokaichampions.com/) (Known as *Desafio Champions Sendokai* in Spanish) is an animated series developed by Kotoc Productions and produced by RTVE, Planeta Junior, and Kotoc. Aired in 2013, the show debuted with many official dubs including Spanish (The main language), English, and [even Arabic!](https://www.arabic-toons.com/m7arbi-sendokai-1434722187-11103.html#sets).

However, the English dub is now considered *Lost Media* after being taken down from their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampionsEnglish), with no other official hosting. The production team had slowly been uploading the English dubs to their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampionsEnglish), until one day everything was taken down without any explanation. 

Currently the only readily availiable dub of the series is the Spanish version, which is found on their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampions). The entirety of Season 1 in English was archived and uploaded to an [Unofficial YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sendokaichampions7678), however finding Season 2 is much more challenging. Since the production team had only uploaded the first 6 episodes of Season 2, the rest of the episodes are considered lost media. Those 6 episodes can be found on the depths of KissCartoon or BilliBilli, but the quality is not the best.

This project aims to recreate the English subtitles for the entire series, so that fans can enjoy the show in English once again! 

## Progress:

**Legend:**
- 游릴 = Completed
    - This means that the subtitles for this particular episode are complete and ready to be used
- 游릱 = Abandoned
    - This means that the subtitles for this particular episode are incomplete, and the person working on them has abandoned the project. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to claim it in the `Issues` tab!
- 游릳 = In Progress
    - Someone has claimed this episode and is currently working on it. Check the `Issues` tab to see who's working on it!
- 游린 = Not Started
    - No one has claimed this episode yet. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to claim it in the `Issues` tab!

- \* $\implies$ Episode has a surviving English dub, and is much easier to subtitle. It's recommended to leave these episodes for last, as they're the easiest to subtitle. It may not end up being necissary to subtitle them at all, as the English dub is already availiable.
