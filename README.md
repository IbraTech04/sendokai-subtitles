## 🎬 About This Project

Welcome to the Sendokai Champions Subtitles project! This repository aims to recreate English subtitles for the animated series "Sendokai Champions" (also known as *Desafio Champions Sendokai*). This open-source repository is a place where fans and volunteers can contribute to making the show accessible to English-speaking audiences.

## 📺 Background & Premise

[**Sendokai Champions**](http://www.sendokaichampions.com/) (Known as *Desafio Champions Sendokai* in Spanish) is an animated series developed by Kotoc Productions and produced by RTVE, Planeta Junior, and Kotoc. Aired in 2013, the show debuted with many official dubs including Spanish (The main language), English, and [even Arabic!](https://www.arabic-toons.com/m7arbi-sendokai-1434722187-11103.html#sets).

### 🚨 The Lost Media Crisis

However, the English dub is now considered ***Lost Media*** after being taken down from their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampionsEnglish), with no other official hosting. The production team had slowly been uploading the English dubs to their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampionsEnglish), until one day everything was taken down without any explanation.

Currently the only readily available dub of the series is the Spanish version, which is found on their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampions). ~~The entirety of Season 1 in English was archived and uploaded to an [Unofficial YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sendokaichampions7678)~~ This was taken down recently as well, however finding Season 2 is much more challenging. Since the production team had only uploaded the first 6 episodes of Season 2, the rest of the episodes are considered lost media. Those 6 episodes can be found on the depths of KissCartoon or BilliBilli, but their quality leaves much to be desired.

### Our Mission

This project aims to recreate the English subtitles for the entire series, so that fans can enjoy the show in English once again!

## Current Progress

As of **June 4th 2025 at 8:20PM EST**, the English subtitles for **Season 2** are complete in their entirety! The Arabic subtitles for **Sengate** are also complete (pending review), with the English Subtitles being ripped and archived on this repository from the official YouTube video.

You can now use [**Subly**](https://github.com/IbraTech04/subly) to inject these subtitles into the episodes, allowing you to watch them with English subtitles!

It is done, Senkuns.
