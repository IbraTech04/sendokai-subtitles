# Sendokai Champions Subtitles 
An open-source repository aiming to be a collaborative effort to recreate English subtitles for the show "Sendokai Champions" (AKA "Defasio Champions Sendokai")

*Instructions for how to contribute can be found below*

## Premise 
[Sendokai Champions](http://www.sendokaichampions.com/) (Known as *Defasio Champions Sendokai* in Spanish) is a Spanish animated series developed by Kotoc Productions and produced by RTVE, Planeta Junior, and Kotoc. Aired in 2013, the show was originally aired in Spanish, and later dubbed in English for airing on Cartoon Network. However, the English dub is now considered *Lost Media* after being taken down from their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampionsEnglish), with no other Official hosting. Currently, only the Spanish version is available on their [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampions), and very few English-dubbed episodes are available on the internet - most of which are low-quality and incomplete. The entirety of Season 1 was archived and uploaded to a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sendokaichampions7678), and only the first few episodes of season 2 can be found archived on websites like BilliBilli and KissCartoon.

## Progress:
Currently, I've been focusing on the second season since it's the most saught after. Once the second season is finished, we can consider working on the first; Though since it's already been dubbed in English, it's not as high of a priority.

**Legend:**
- 游릴 = Completed
    - This means that the subtitles for this particular episode are complete and ready to be used
- 游릱 = Abandoned
    - This means that the subtitles for this particular episode are incomplete, and the person working on them has abandoned the project. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to claim it in the `Issues` tab!
- 游릳 = In Progress
    - Someone has claimed this episode and is currently working on it. Check the `Issues` tab to see who's working on it!
- 游린 = Not Started
    - No one has claimed this episode yet. If you're interested in helping out, feel free to claim it in the `Issues` tab!

- \* $\implies$ Episode has a surviving English dub, and is much easier to subtitle. It's recommended to leave these episodes for last, as they're the easiest to subtitle.

## How to Contribute
Ready to help out? Great! Here's how you can get started:

**This repository relies on GitFlow**. If you're not familiar with Git, I reccomend you read up on it before contributing. You can find a great guide [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

### Step 1: Claim an Episode
First, check the progress section above to see which episodes are available. If you see an episode that's not claimed, feel free to claim it by creating an `Issue` in this repository. This will let others know that you're working on it, and will prevent others from working on the same episode at the same time (causing merge conflicts). If someone else is working on the episode you want to work on, feel free to reach out to them and see if they need any help!

### Step 2: Acquire the required resources
You'll need to acquire the Spanish version of the episode you're working on. You can do this by downloading the episode from the [Official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SendokaiChampions) using an online tool, or even better! [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

You'll also need a `.srt` editor. I personally reccomend and use [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/), but you can use any `.srt` editor you like.

### Step 3: Clone this repository
You'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, or using the GUI buttons on the GitHub website. If you really wanna get fancy, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to clone the repository. If you know how to use Git, you can use the following command:

```bash
git clone github.com/ibratech04/sendokai-champions-subtitles
```

### Step 4: Subtitle the Episode! 
Once you're all setup, you can start subtitling the episode! You can do this by opening the `.srt` file for the episode you're working on in your `.srt` editor, loading in the episode, and adding the subtitles. Once you're done, save the file and move onto the next step.

This step will take you the longest, at around 20-30 minutes per episode.

### Step 5: Push your changes and create a Pull Request
Once you're done, push your changes to the repository and create a Pull Request. This will let others know that you're done, and will allow others to review your work. If there are any issues, you can make the necessary changes and push them to the repository. Once your Pull Request is approved, your subtitles will be added to the repository and marked as complete!
