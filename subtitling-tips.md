# How to subtitle effectively

Subtitling is a difficult task, and it can be hard to get right. Here are some tips and tricks to help you subtitle effectively:

## 1. Use AI to your advantage

AI can be a powerful tool when subtitling. Tools like [HappyScribe](https://www.happyscribe.com/), [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), and [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) can help you transcribe the audio of the episode, making it easier to create subtitles! ChatGPT (Especially GPT4) can also provide more accurate context-based translations for the subtitles. I haven't tried other LLMs like Google Gemini, but I would assume they would also work well.

I've started using Adobe Premiere Pro's [Speech to Text](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/speech-to-text.html) feature, which is a great way to quickly generate subtitles for the episode. It works surprisingly well, and can save you a lot of time when subtitling!

## 2. Know the context

It may be wise to re-watch the episode you're subtitling, or at least the scenes you're subtitling. This will help you understand the context of the scene, and will help you create more accurate subtitles. If you speak a language in which the episode is dubbed, it may also help to watch the episode in that language to get a better understanding of the characters and their personalities.

It is also advisable to watch some parts of the Season 1 English Dub, as it can help you understand how the characters speak and act. This will not only help you make more accurate subtitles, but can drastically speed up the subtitling process! 

## 3. Re-watch the English Season One Dub

It may help to watch the English Dub of Season One beforehand, as it can help you understand how the characters speak and act. This will not only help you make more accurate subtitles, but can drastically speed up the subtitling process!

## 4. Take breaks regularly

Trust me, subtitling can and **will** make you go insane. It's important to take breaks regularly to prevent burnout. I recommend taking a 5-10 minute break every 30 minutes to an hour. This will help you stay focused and prevent burnout.

## 5. Use the proper tools

I cannot reccomend [SubtitleEdit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) enough. It's a great tool for creating and editing subtitles, and it has a lot of features that make subtitling easier. It also has a built-in translation feature, which can help you translate the subtitles into other languages!
