# How to subtitle effectively

Subtitling is a difficult task, and it can be hard to get right. Here are some tips and tricks to help you subtitle effectively:

# 1. Use AI to your advantage! 
AI can be a powerful tool when subtitling. Tools like [HappyScribe](https://www.happyscribe.com/), [Descript](https://www.descript.com/), and [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) can help you transcribe the audio of the episode, making it easier to create subtitles! ChatGPT (Especially GPT4) can also provide more accurate context-based translations for the subtitles. I haven't tried other LLMs like Google Gemini, but I would assume they would also work well.

# 2. Know the context
It may be wise to re-watch the episode you're subtitling, or at least the scenes you're subtitling. This will help you understand the context of the scene, and will help you create more accurate subtitles.

# 3. Re-watch the English Season One Dub
It may help to watch the English Dub of Season One beforehand, as it can help you understand how the characters speak and act. This will not only help you make more accurate subtitles, but can drastically speed up the subtitling process! 

# 4. Take breaks regularly
Trust me, subtitling can and **will** make you go insane. It's important to take breaks regularly to prevent burnout. I reccomend taking a 5-10 minute break every 30 minutes to an hour. This will help you stay focused and prevent burnout.
