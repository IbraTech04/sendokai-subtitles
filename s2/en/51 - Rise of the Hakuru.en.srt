1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Attack!!

2
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:50,151
Whoever wears that helmet will become

3
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,036
the great Zorn

4
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:56,436
Masara-Sen-Fracta!

5
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,968
He's split himself into four warriors!

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,543
Nero-At-Sen

7
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:36,669
Nero-Sen Fusion!

8
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,683
It's over

9
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
Let's hold on as long as we can. We have to

10
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,510
buy time for your children

11
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,289
to destroy Sestrad's Chest.

12
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,670
After so many years being enemies

13
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,156
We are going to die as companions.

14
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:14,270
Maybe you are right, but first
we are going to fight as brothers

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Attack!

16
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,010
Come on, Lon. Become the Grand Zorn

17
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,139
And everything I said will be fulfilled.

18
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:43,645
I don't need you to achieve
that! I am a Sendokai Warrior!

19
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,483
I can offer you a lot more

20
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,166
What did you do?

21
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:08,964
I am a Chron. I can
dominate space and time.

22
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,290
I transmitted my most
valuable power to the helmet

23
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:16,837
Because others can only
dream to wear the helmet

24
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:22,350
Whoever wears the
helmet will become immortal

25
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,525
The Baron Ragnaki takes
the majority of the field

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,285
Why are you fighting?

27
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,078
My fusion is more powerful than yours!

28
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:58,555
I've stolen the energy from
thousands of Masarians!

29
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,250
Maybe you can steal energy

30
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,707
But you can't steal our feelings!

31
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,150
How is this possible?

32
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,871
Kai.... For the Humans

33
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:37,602
The humans win the
grand Sendokai tournament!

34
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,590
My energy!

35
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,036
Give me back my energy!

36
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,069
The chest is damaged

37
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,823
His power over the Yakis is going to fade

38
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,952
The Senkuns did it!

39
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:45,130
Yes! The gang have defeated Sidmodius!

40
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:02,497
Chronan-Yatt, where are you?

41
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,684
Damn you!

42
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,410
You've failed, Sidmodius

43
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:13,336
At last! The people of Masara
are going to know the truth.

44
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,955
Who's this "Sidmodius"?

45
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,669
I'm the Baron Ragnaki!

46
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,312
These have nothing to do with me!

47
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,036
It's him!

48
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,053
He transformed us into Yakis!

49
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,073
We wanted to give you [something]

50
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:16,750
Thanks to you, the earth is a free planet

51
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,958
No. Congratulations to you!

52
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,900
Now I know where your children's talent

53
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,516
for combat comes from

54
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:33,330
Please. Sentimentality gives me a headache.

55
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Who?

56
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,323
For me?

57
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,010
Thank you....

58
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:03,092
Hey! You're the famous Kiet
who saved the multiverse twice!

59
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,280
In the flesh!

60
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,540
And you're legendary Fenzi

61
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,444
Not very tall, but very fast!

62
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Yeah!

63
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,000
The great Sendokai tournament has finished!

64
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,550
And  as everyone agreed

65
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,040
The leader of the winning team

66
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,870
Will be Masara's new leader!

67
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,030
Congratulations, Zack

68
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,120
You wanted to be a good Hakuru

69
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:51,725
And you've become the
best Hakuru in the multiverse

70
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,931
Thank you. It's a great
honor, but I cannot accept it

71
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,785
It was with the Kiwuns that I learned
the true meaning of being a Hakuru

72
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:19,055
That is why your leader should be a Kiwun

73
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,836
The noblest and bravest in themselves

74
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,326
Thank you, Thank you! I don't deserve it

75
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Kido.

76
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,168
What?! But I don't know how?

77
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,055
Just like Danima says

78
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,905
Put on the helmet, Lon

79
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,459
Become the Great Zorn

80
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,909
But I'm not evil

81
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:19,671
This has nothing to do with good and evil

82
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,110
It's about justice

83
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,199
Because only by being
the great Zorn can you

84
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:31,589
Make justice fall on those
who abandoned you on

85
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,561
Those who lied to you

86
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,096
And made you believe they loved you

87
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:39,863
Those who betrayed you
and stole what was yours

88
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Like Zack!

89
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,560
Traitor!

90
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,455
Sidmodius....

91
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,165
We had a deal! I was
going to be The Great Zorn!

92
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,089
I always knew Lon would be The Great Zorn

93
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,470
I used for my purposes like a puppet

94
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,589
Look what your puppet is doing!

95
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,216
My mission is complete

96
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,130
Evil has come back

97
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,623
The portal isn't working!

98
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,684
Something has happened to the Cronix

99
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,926
Oh no!

100
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:56,959
If the portal doesn't work, the team
will be trapped in Masara.... forever

101
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,019
At last, it's all over!

102
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:13,955
If everything is over, does it mean
we can finally talk about ourselves?

103
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,796
What's that sound?
