1
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,559
Whoever has that helmet will become

2
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,329
the great one.

3
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,950
I thought,

4
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
let's hold on as long as we can. We have to

5
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,510
buy time for your children

6
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,640
to destroy the box of that extra.

7
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,670
After so many years being enemies, we are going

8
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,580
to die as companions. Maybe

9
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,690
you are right, but first we are going to fight

10
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,920
as brothers.

11
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,010
Come on, it turns it into the great weapon and

12
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,330
everything I said will be fulfilled.

13
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,850
What I need to achieve that. I am a

14
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,960
warrior without touching. I

15
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,689
can offer you a lot.

16
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:06,150
In fact, I am a chronicle. I can dominate

17
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,150
space-time. My desire I have

18
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,090
transmitted to the helmet. My most valuable.

19
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,650
power

20
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,189
because others can only dream who

21
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,220
wears a helmet

22
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,570
and mortal

23
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,430
more powerful decisions but stolen the

24
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,530
energy of thousands of material

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,390
they can steal energy but they cannot

26
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,620
steal a feeling

27
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,069
it is possible

28
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:35,860
and we humans join in

29
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,590
and in the day

30
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,030
and my energy

31
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,010
the house is damaged  Your power over the

32
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,540
Yaquis is going to fade,

33
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,349
great

34
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,710
town, so if the boys have

35
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,449
defeated without a motive,

36
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,600
where

37
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,340
else are there failures and hatred, finally the people

38
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,770
of Massa are going to know the whole truth,

39
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,260
here

40
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,200
this has nothing to do with my party,

41
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,620
we wanted to congratulate you, thanks to

42
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,750
you the earth is a free planet

43
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,710
no congratulations to you now I know

44
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,900
where your children's talent

45
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,230
for combat comes from and please stop so much

46
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,330
sentimentality gives me a headache

47
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,810
for me

48
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,010
thank you

49
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,010
answer

50
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,339
and you are the famous one who saved the

51
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,300
multiverse twice  people and you are

52
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,540
pencil the legendary although I am not going to

53
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,080
this one but extremely fast e

54
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,500
d

55
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,000
and the great tournament of one hundred each

56
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,550
and as everyone agreed

57
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,040
the leader of the winning team

58
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,870
will be the new leader

59
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,030
congratulations I

60
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,450
wanted to be a cool account and you have

61
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,030
become the best  of the multiverse

62
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,420
thank you it is a great honor but I cannot

63
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,810
accept it it

64
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,770
was with the kibbutz that I learned the

65
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,810
true meaning of being an [ __ ]

66
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,710
your team

67
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,179
that is why your leader should be a

68
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,080
guy who is

69
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,860
the noblest and bravest in themselves thank you

70
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,150
and I don't deserve it

71
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,960
but I  not about doing it like he once told me he

72
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,470
encourages no one knows until he

73
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,830
learns that's why they

74
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,700
expect battle lines

75
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,230
where the helmet turns him into the big

76
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,550
fox

77
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm not evil this has nothing to do

78
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,540
with good and evil but with

79
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,110
justice

80
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,339
because  Only by being the great sun can you

81
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,740
make justice fall on

82
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,589
those who abandoned you on

83
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,260
those who lied to you and made you

84
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,990
believe they loved you on those who

85
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,300
betrayed you and stole what was

86
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,510
yours

87
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,560
the

88
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,690
godless editor we had a deal I was going to  Being an

89
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,690
actor I

90
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,089
always knew I would be the great one

91
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,230
I have used for my purposes like a

92
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,470
puppet

93
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:19,019
look what your puppet is doing

94
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,370
I start the continuity

95
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,190
the portal does not work something has

96
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,760
happened to the krone with or without the portal

97
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,250
the boys will be trapped in

98
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,589
masada to  always

99
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,019
finally everything is over

100
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,309
because if everything is over it means that we

101
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,980
can now talk about ourselves

102
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,000
and that was it
