1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Attack!

2
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:53,036
Whoever wears that helmet
will become the great Zorn

3
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:56,436
<i>Masara-Sen-Fracta!</i>

4
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,968
 He's split himself into four warriors!

5
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,534
<i>Nero-At-Sen</i>

6
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:36,669
Nero-Sen Fusion!

7
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,683
It's over

8
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,639
Let's hold on as long as
we can. We have to buy

9
00:01:56,663 --> 00:02:00,289
time for your children to
destroy Sestrad's Chest.

10
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,670
After so many years being enemies

11
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,156
We are going to die as companions.

12
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:14,270
Maybe you are right, but first
we are going to fight as brothers

13
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Attack!

14
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,010
Come on, Lon. Become the Grand Zorn

15
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,139
And everything I said will be fulfilled.

16
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:43,645
I don't need you to achieve
that! I am a Sendokai Warrior!

17
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,483
I can offer you a lot more

18
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,166
What did you do?

19
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:08,964
I am a Chronek. I can
control space-time at will.

20
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,290
I transmitted my most
valuable power to the helmet

21
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:16,837
A power that others can only dream of.

22
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:22,074
Whoever wears the
helmet will become immortal

23
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,525
The BarÃ³n Raknaki takes
the majority of the field

24
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,078
Why are you fighting? My
fusion is more powerful than yours!

25
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:58,555
I've stolen the energy from
thousands of Masarians!

26
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,250
Maybe you can steal energy

27
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,707
But you can't steal our feelings!

28
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,150
How is this possible?

29
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,871
Kai.... For the Humans

30
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:37,602
The humans win the
Great Sendokai tournament!

31
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,590
My energy!

32
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,036
Give me back my energy!

33
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,069
The chest is damaged

34
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,823
His power over the Yakis is going to fade

35
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:40,952
The Senkuns did it!

36
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:45,130
Yes! The gang have defeated Sidmodius!

37
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:02,497
Chronam-Yatt, where are you?

38
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,684
Damn you!

39
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:09,410
You've failed, Sidmodius

40
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:13,336
At last! The people of Masara
are going to know the truth.

41
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,955
Who's this "Sidmodius"?

42
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,669
I'm the BarÃ³n Raknaki!

43
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,312
These have nothing to do with me!

44
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,036
It's him!

45
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,053
He transformed us into Yakis!

46
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,730
Fools! You are nothing
but insignificant insects!

47
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,073
We wanted to congratulate you

48
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:16,750
Thanks to you, the earth is a free planet

49
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,958
No. Congratulations to you!

50
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:25,185
Now I know where your children's
talent for combat comes from

51
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:32,424
Please. Sentimentality
gives me a headache.

52
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,005
Who?

53
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,068
For me?

54
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,685
Thank you....

55
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:03,215
Hey! You're the famous Kiet
who saved the multiverse twice!

56
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,705
In the flesh!

57
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,404
And you're legendary Fenzy

58
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:10,615
Not very tall, but very fast!

59
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Yeah!

60
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,545
The Great Sendokai tournament has finished!

61
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,870
And as everyone agreed the leader of the
winning team will be Masara's new leader!

62
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,030
Congratulations, Zak

63
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,120
You wanted to be a good Hakuru

64
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:51,725
And you've become the
best Hakuru in the multiverse

65
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,855
Thank you. It's a great
honor, but I cannot accept it

66
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:08,034
It was with the Kiwuns that I learned
the true meaning of being a Hakuru

67
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:09,894
Your team

68
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,800
That is why your leader should be a Kiwun

69
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,836
The noblest and bravest in themselves

70
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,326
Thank you, Thank you! I don't deserve it

71
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,776
Kido.

72
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,168
What?! But I don't know how?

73
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,055
Just like Danima says

74
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,940
No one knows until they learn.

75
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:46,511
Give it up for Masara's new leader!

76
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,905
Put on the helmet, Lon

77
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,459
Become the Great Zorn

78
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:15,806
But I'm not evil

79
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:19,671
This has nothing to do with good and evil

80
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,110
It's about justice

81
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,577
Because only by being
the great Zorn can you

82
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:31,339
Make justice fall on those
who abandoned you on

83
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:36,096
Those who lied to you
And made you believe they loved you

84
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:39,863
Those who betrayed you
and stole what was yours

85
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Like Zak!

86
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,315
Traitor!

87
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:56,455
Sidmodius....

88
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,165
We had a deal! I was
going to be The Great Zorn!

89
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,089
I always knew Lon would be The Great Zorn

90
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:12,495
I used you for my purposes like a puppet

91
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,589
Look what your puppet is doing!

92
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,216
My mission is complete

93
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,130
Evil has come back

94
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,623
The portal isn't working!

95
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,684
Something has happened to the Chroneks

96
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,926
Oh no!

97
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:56,959
If the portal doesn't work, the team
will be trapped in Masara forever

98
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,019
At last, it's all over!

99
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:12,523
If everything is over, does that mean
we can finally talk about ourselves?

100
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,796
What's that sound?
