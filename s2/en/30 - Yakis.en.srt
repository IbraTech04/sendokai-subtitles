1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,961
So, you're saying we're
this little mark here?

2
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,056
Right

3
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,393
And this red guy's a Yaki.

4
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,727
And if we follow the Yaki's
trail, he'll lead us to Sidmodius.

5
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,267
Cool!

6
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:53,909
Yeah. You can tell he's the <i>Hakuru</i>

7
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,907
Although, it's not totally accurate

8
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:59,941
Don't worry.

9
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,498
It looks like Kido can
follow a trail too...

10
00:01:02,523 --> 00:01:03,723
Or... something

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,850
We're on the right track!

12
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,221
Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,701
This is all great and everything, but

14
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,265
Is it much further?

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,302
According to the map, the
Yakis should be...

16
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:25,691
Right here

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,454
Wow! This is worse than my bedroom!

18
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,442
Hey, guys! Check this out

19
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:45,494
Isn't that the helmet the
Marshal wore during the final?

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah,

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,915
The Great Zorn's helmet.

22
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:57,561
Uh oh

23
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,453
Looks like we found our friend.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,080
He's close by!

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,160
I can feel it.

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,423
I don't understand.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
What's wrong?

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,120
The Yakis should be worried.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,432
Right here.

30
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,560
Hit his energy center!

31
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:41,840
Where are you going?

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
You one-eyed ape!

33
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,224
Quick! Follow him!

34
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,680
All right, we're ready to go.

35
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,360
What's wrong, Tanpo?

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
I had a premonition.

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,080
I think the youngsters are in danger.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,880
I'm sure they are.

39
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,400
They're Sendokai warriors.

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,600
But you shouldn't worry about them.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Because thanks to you, they're the best.

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
You're right.

43
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
There's no time to waste!

44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,720
We must discover
why Sidmodius has gone to Masara!

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,280
And where will we do that?

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,039
Where all the knowledge of the multiverse
is stored

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,935
In the great Tower of the <i>Beldzar</i> Dimension

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
But, isn't that where-

49
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,160
Yes, Lalith.

50
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
That is where he is.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,400
I lost him.

52
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
He's not on the map.

53
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,440
Well, at least
we still have the iguana with the mohawk.

54
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,040
Kido, what are you doing?

55
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Have you ever seen a Yaki attack a coconut?

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,380
No.

57
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,600
Precisely!

58
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
If the Yakis think I'm a coconut

59
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,175
I'll be able to sneak up on them
unnoticed and attack!

60
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,216
Hey Zak!

61
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,240
What you said about going to the movies.

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Is that still on?

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,840
Yeah.

64
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah, sure.

65
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
Great.

66
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,400
Because it would be a shame
if we didn't get to go out on our date.

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm not going to let you escape.

68
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,760
Wow, I-

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
That's right, Yaki!

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,616
I'm not going to let you escape.

71
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
What were you saying?

72
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,880
Nothing.

73
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,821
Forget it.

74
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't move!

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Look at that footprint.

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Is it a yaki?

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,699
No, it looks like a smiley face.

78
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,769
Isn't that hillarious?

79
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Hey, I see him!

80
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
There's a red dot

81
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,575
and another.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
And another.

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
It's an ambush!

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,960
Quick!

85
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,880
Attack!

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We need more dos!

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm a coconut

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm a coconut

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,600
That yaki...

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,356
I think he's level two. Yeah.

91
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,400
Yeah... I don't see any difference.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,822
Zet-Sen shot!

93
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,840
Okay, so he's different.

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
A high priestess.

95
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,337
The other Yakis. Were they?

96
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:56,571
Yes

97
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,987
Your brothers.

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,800
Keenan!

99
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,467
Keeway! It's me. Kido!

100
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,736
It's me, Kido!

101
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
Your brother!

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,710
You crazy lizard!

103
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
We just want to help you

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Tai-sen Trail!

105
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,360
This is bad.

106
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
Goa-Sen Sheild!

107
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Kiet! Behind you!

108
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,595
Kiet!

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,902
No!

110
00:08:57,365 --> 00:09:00,365
Guys, retreat!

111
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,384
You don't scare me.

112
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,360
Lon!

113
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Let's go.

114
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,920
I've almost got him.

115
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,157
I said let's go!

116
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:46,880
Are you okay?

117
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Sure.

118
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,844
It's nothing.

119
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,080
You're a coward.

120
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,000
We could have beaten them.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,920
It was too dangerous.

122
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,135
I'm not going to risk
my friend's lives for nothing.

123
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,213
Or yours?

124
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
What happened?

125
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
Three. Yuki's surrounded us.

126
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,415
One of them was level two.

127
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,520
I see.

128
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Then you will have to be stronger.

129
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
I will train you.

130
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,815
I will show you the most powerful
techniques ever een on Masara.

131
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
I don't believe it!

132
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,106
The Sorceress of the Sen
herself is going to train us!

133
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:44,765
That Yaki's going to
learn not to mess with Kiet!

134
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
Stay calm.

135
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,600
Go home now.

136
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,840
You need to rest.

137
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,932
This is only the beginning.

138
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,320
It could work, my little ones.

139
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Now they're at their weakest.

140
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:13,800
This is the time to crush those humans.

141
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,200
Forget them!

142
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
What? Out of the question!

143
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,440
First, you must grow stronger.

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,247
You will travel Masara destroying every village in your
path and absorbing all the energy of the inhabitants.

145
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,760
I'm starting to like this plan of yours.
