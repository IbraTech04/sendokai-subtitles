1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So you're seeing we're this little mark here,

1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
right? And this red guy's a Yankee. And we follow the Yankees trail. He'll lead us to sit modius

1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
cool

1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah you can tell he's the hawk homebrew

1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
although it's not totally accurate

1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't worry. It looks like keto can follow a trail to or something

1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we're on the right track. Oh, yeah. This is all great and everything but is it much further?

1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,000
According to the map? The Yaquis shouldn't be right here

1
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
wow, this is worse than my bedroom

1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hey guys, check this out

1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
isn't that the helmet the martial war during the final? Yeah.

1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The great swords helmet

1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, looks like we found our friend.

1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's close by feet.

1
00:02:04,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't understand what's wrong. The yaki shouldn't be right here.

1
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:41,000
His energy center

1
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you going you want I'd hate

1
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Quick follow him

1
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
all right. We're ready to go. What's wrong tempo?

1
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had a premonition. I think the youngsters are in danger.

1
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sure they are their senator chi warriors. But you shouldn't worry about them. Because thanks to you, they're the best.

1
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're right. There's no time to waste. We must discover why sit modius has gone to Massara.

1
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And where will we do that?

1
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where all the knowledge of the multiverse is stored in the great tower of the belts are dimension.

1
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But isn't that way?

1
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes. Leith. That is where he is.

1
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I lost him. He's not on the map.

1
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, that least we still have the guano with the Mohawk.

1
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Quito What are you doing? Have you ever seen a Yaquis attack a coconut? No. Precisely if the Yaks think I'm a coconut I'll be able to sneak up on them

1
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
unnoticed

1
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't poop

1
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, Zach, what you said about going to the movies? Is that still on

1
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000

1
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
great because it would be a shame if we didn't get to go out on our date

1
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not going to let you escape

1
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000

1
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:59,000

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000

1
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, I see him there's a red dot and another and another

1
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:59,000

1
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000

1
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000

1
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000

1
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,000

Are you okay? Sure. There's nothing You're a coward. We could have beaten them. It was too dangerous.

1
00:09:58,000 --> 00:010:09,000
I'm not going to risked my friends lives for nothing. Or yours

1
00:010:09,000 --> 00:010:10,000
What happened?

1
00:010:10,000 --> 00:010:17,000
Three Yaquis surrounded us. One of them was level two.

1
00:010:17,000 --> 00:010:31,000
I see them you will have to be stronger. I will train you. I will show you the most powerful techniques ever seen on Massara.

1
00:010:31,000 --> 00:010:40,000
I don't believe it. The Sorcerer's suffer said herself is going to train us

1
00:010:40,000 --> 00:010:47,000
that yaki is going to learn not to mess with yet. Oh

1
00:010:47,000 --> 00:011:04,000
stay calm. Go home now. You will need to rest this is only the beginning

1
00:011:04,000 --> 00:011:39,000
good work my weakest. This is the time to crush those humans. Forget them. I would ask that question. First, you must grow stronger. He will travel Massara destroying every village in your path and absorbing all the energy of the inhabitants

1
00:011:39,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm starting to like this planet
