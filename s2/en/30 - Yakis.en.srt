1
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,961
So, you're saying we're
this little mark here?

2
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:42,056
Right

3
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,393
And this red guy's a Yaki.

4
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:48,727
And if we follow the Yaki's
trail. He'll lead us to Sidmodius.

5
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,267
Cool!

6
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:53,909
Yeah. You can tell he's the Hakuru

7
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,907
Although, it's not totally accurate

8
00:00:58,932 --> 00:00:59,941
Don't worry.

9
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,498
It looks like Kido can
follow a trail too...

10
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:03,806
Or... something

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,850
We're on the right track!

12
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:13,221
Oh, yeah.

13
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,701
 This is all great and everything, but

14
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,265
Is it much further?

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,994
According to the map, the
Yakis shouldn't be...

16
00:01:24,406 --> 00:01:25,691
Right here

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,454
Wow! This is worse than my bedroom!

18
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,442
Hey guys. Check this out

19
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,494
Isn't that the helmet the
marshal war during the final?

20
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,212
Yeah.

21
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:49,901
The great Zorn's helmet

22
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:57,845
Uh oh

23
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,647
Looks like we found our friend

24
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:04,000
He's close by! I can feel it!

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,403
I don't understand!

26
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:07,548
What's wrong?

27
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:11,310
The Yakis should be right here

28
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,722
Hit his energy center!

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,236
Where are you going, you one-eyed ape!

30
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,264
Quick, follow him!

31
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,010
Alright, we're ready to go!

32
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,286
What's wrong, Tanpo?

33
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:09,764
I had a premonition.

34
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:13,975
I think the youngsters are in danger.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,799
I'm sure they are

36
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:18,093
 They're Sendokai warriors.

37
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:23,849
But you shouldn't worry about them.
Because thanks to you, they're the best.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,287
You're right! There's no time to waste.

39
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:33,776
We must discover why
Sidmodius has gone to Massara.

40
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:36,393
And where will we do that?

41
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,408
Where all the knowledge
of the multiverse is stored

42
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:44,685
In the great tower of
the Beldzar dimension.

43
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,343
But isn't that where-

44
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:52,376
Yes, Lallith. That is where he is.

45
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,022
I lost him! He's not on the map!

46
00:04:59,047 --> 00:05:03,172
Well, that least we still have
the iguana with a mohawk

47
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,963
Kido, what are you doing?

48
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:09,026
Have you ever seen a Yaki attack a coconut?

49
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,126
No.

50
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:15,975
Precisely if the Yakis think I'm a
coconut I'll be able to sneak up on them

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
unnoticed

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,878
And attack!

53
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,209
Hey, Zach!

54
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,461
What you said about going to the movies?

55
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,846
Is that still on?

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
yeah yeah sure

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000

Are you okay? Sure. There's nothing You're a coward. We could have beaten them. It was too dangerous.

77
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not going to risked my friends lives for nothing. Or yours

78
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What happened?

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Three Yaquis surrounded us. One of them was level two.

80
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I see them you will have to be stronger. I will train you. I will show you the most powerful techniques ever seen on Massara.

81
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't believe it. The Sorcerer's suffer said herself is going to train us

82
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
that yaki is going to learn not to mess with yet. Oh

83
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:04,000
stay calm. Go home now. You will need to rest this is only the beginning

84
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:39,000
good work my weakest. This is the time to crush those humans. Forget them. I would ask that question. First, you must grow stronger. He will travel Massara destroying every village in your path and absorbing all the energy of the inhabitants

85
00:11:39,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm starting to like this planet
