1
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:41,655
Alright. I'm going to the
movies with Cloe today.

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm going to the movies with Cloe today!

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to the movies with Cloe

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm going to the movies.

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
You can't go anywhere today.

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,648
You have to stay home
with your sister.

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,560
Your father and I are going out for
dinner tonight. Don't you remember?

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,343
Oh, no.

9
00:01:13,296 --> 00:01:16,535
Yes? Oh hey, Zak!

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
I'm about to leave.

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,600
What's wrong?

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,535
Well, I think we're going to
have to cancel on the movies

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,028
What? Again? Why?

14
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:35,160
I have to babysit my
sister I didn't remember.

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,280
No, no. Don't worry.
It's not your fault.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,928
See you tomorrow.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,795
How do you cook this?

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,107
Pizza? Yes, I know how to do it!

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,654
Perfect!

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
No, no, no, no!

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Ona, be careful!

24
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,251
Close one!

25
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,655
They're calling us

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,412
But I can't leave you alone!

27
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,323
Zak and Lon have managed to
control The Duo-Sen Force into

28
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:14,280
an attack power. But
Sendokai, it's not all attack.

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Kiet and Fenzy

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,160
You must unleash a defensive power.

31
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The Duo-Sen Wall

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,872
If anyone knows how
to stop a do, it's us!

33
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:28,776
Yeah!

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,040
Now some former disciples of mine
will come so you can practice with them.

35
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,760
What happened to Zack?

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
He couldn't come.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,960
He had to-

38
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,028
I'm here. Look.

39
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,536
Zak!

40
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Well, well, well.

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,480
So you couldn't leave the house
because you had to look after your sister.

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, well, the truth is.

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,920
You've got a bug on your back!

44
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,040
Get away from me.

45
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll kill it.

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,960
Don't worry.

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
Hello, little one.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,054
How cute.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,772
Guys, meet The Grubers

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,366
Hello, priestess.
It's been a long time.

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,760
Grubers! Formation!

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,560
To survive in Masara, The Grubers
became geniuses of technology.

53
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,262
Attack formation!

54
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,918
Relax, guys. We'll activate The
Duo-Sen Wall And we'll defeat them.

55
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,055
There's only one who can defeat
a druber!

56
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,903
Another Druber!

57
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:45,560
No. Don't move from here, okay?

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,434
Sen-Do-Kai!

59
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,040
This will be a two-kai fight.

60
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,241
Let the Sendokai begin!

61
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,377
Duo-Sen Fury!

62
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,173
Kai!

63
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Oh, no.

64
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,934
They're very strong.

65
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,392
A Gruber, always wins
the fights he enters!

66
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:05,465
And the ones he doesn't, too

67
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,762
What's going on?

68
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:12,965
She's attacking me!

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
584! 584!

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,137
I need backup!

71
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,358
Ona!

72
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
Zak

73
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,335
Either you take care of your sister
or you fight with us.

74
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,200
But it can't be both.

75
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,453
Excuse me.

76
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:59,672
Lon! Let's get this over with.

77
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,828
Duo-Sen Force!

78
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:18,344
Ona!

79
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,875
Kai!

80
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:51,286
If you can't take fighting
seriously, you shouldn't have come.

81
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,319
Kiet! I think those squirrels
are eager to try our medicine.

82
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,202
Duo-Sen Fury!

83
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:32,256
Duo-Sen Wall!

84
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,800
Wow

85
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,123
We did that.

86
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:56,233
Lon! Now we can use
the Duo-Sen Force!

87
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,533
Nu-Sen Flare!

88
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,908
Kai!

89
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:15,354
Yes!

90
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
End of the Sendokai!

91
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Congratulations.

92
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,400
No one had ever beaten
the Grubers before!

93
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,858
Now we can go to the movies, right?

94
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:47,095
Yes, I just have to drop
Ona off at home before-

95
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,123
Dad! Mom!

96
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,396
There goes my movie.

97
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,080
You have to be very brave
to master that beast.

98
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:05,158
It has earned the
respect of the Grubers

99
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,088
You, follow me.

100
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,160
We're here.

101
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,935
We're here too
watching TV.

102
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
It's not like we went out
and just got back.

103
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh, no, not at all.

104
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,973
Are you watching TV
with the TV off?

105
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,175
There's nothing good on.

106
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,494
I like it better this way.

107
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,678
Zak!
