1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
Alright. I'm going to the movies with Chloe today.

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
I'm going to the movies today.

3
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,000
To the movies with Chloe.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
I'm on my way.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm going to the movies with.

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,960
My meme.

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,840
I'm going to the movies.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,760
You can't go anywhere today.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
You have to stay home
with your sister.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,120
Your father and I are going out for dinner tonight.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
Don't you remember?

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
Oh, no.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes, yes.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
I'm about to leave.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,600
What's wrong?

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,080
Well, I think

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,120
we're going to have to cancel the dolphins.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,440
¿Qué?

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,840
¿Otra vez?

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,800
Why
do I have to babysit my sister?

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,160
I didn't remember.

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
No, no. Don't worry.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
It's not your fault.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
See you tomorrow.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,560
No. How do you cook this?

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Wait a minute.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,200
Pizza? Yes.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What can I make?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,320
Ta-da!

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,320
La perfecta.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Mamá.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,360
No, no, no, no!

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Careful.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,200
With. Care.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
All of it.

37
00:02:47,680
Oh, almost.

38
00:02:51,200
They're calling us.

39
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,760
But I can't leave you alone. A.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
This one.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,600
They've managed to control the force

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,600
into an attack power.

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,280
But in the second case,
it's not all attack.

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,120
Who says so?

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,160
You must unleash a defensive power.

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The wall. Be.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,280
If anyone knows, they stopped two
it's us. Yes.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,040
Now some former
disciples of mine will come

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
so you can practice with them.

50
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,760
What happened to Zack?

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
He couldn't come.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,960
He had to.

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm here. Look.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Well, well, well.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,480
So you couldn't leave the house
because you had to look after your sister.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Yeah, well, the truth is.

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,920
You've got a bug on your back.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,040
Get away from me.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll kill it.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,960
Don't worry.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,520
Hello, little one.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,520
How cute.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
Guys, meet the.

64
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
The.

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Gruber.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
Hello, priestess.

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,080
It's been a long time.

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
What?

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,760
Firm clouds. No.

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
To survive in Masada.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,560
The Grubers became geniuses
of technology.

72
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Formation of gangs.

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
Relax, buddy.

74
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
We'll wake up the Wall. 12.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
And we'll defeat them.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,000
There's only one who can defeat
a thunderclap.

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Another thunder?

78
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
No, you.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Don't move from here.

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Okay.

81
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,640
What?

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
It's the.

83
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Last one.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,040
This will be a two-click fight.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Let the second one begin.

86
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:52,440
Fury. Kai.

87
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Oh, no.

88
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
They're very strong.

89
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
According to Gruber, always.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
He wins the fights he enters
and the ones he doesn't.

91
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Him too.

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
What the hell?

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I won.

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
50 H4.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,520
I need backup.

96
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,800
No. Are there

97
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
blocks?

98
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,000
Either you take care of your sister
or you fight with us.

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,200
But it can't all be.

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Excuse me.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,400
What plan?

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Let's get this over with.

103
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:18,120
Door. One.

104
00:08:46,040
More. If you can't take
fighting seriously, you shouldn't have come.

105
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,840
What?

106
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,560
I think those squirrels are
eager to try our

107
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,560
medicine.

108
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:31,840
With. Fury. 123.

109
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
Vaya.

110
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,800
Madre mía.

111
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
We did that.

112
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Now, if we can do the strength. You.

113
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
This one, me. You.

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Me. Kai. Yes.

115
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
Look.

116
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
End of the second. Kai.

117
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Congratulations.

118
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,400
No one had ever beaten the problems before.

119
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Yeah. It was.

120
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Now we can go to the movies.

121
00:10:41,440
I don't

I just have to drop Ona off at home
before
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Dad, Mom.

124
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
There goes my movie.

125
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,080
You have to be very brave

126
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,080
to master that beast.

127
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
If Guerrero has earned
the respect of the.

128
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
You, follow me.

129
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Raya a.

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,160
We're here.

131
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,120
We're here too
watching TV.

132
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,960
It's not like we went out
and just got back.

133
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh, no, not at all.

134
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,760
Are you
watching TV with the TV off? Right.

135
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,720
There's nothing good on.

136
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I like it better this way.

137
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Dark. And.
