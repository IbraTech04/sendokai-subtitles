1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Guys.

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't you think Zak's been
acting a little weird lately?

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,000
It's normal to be
upset, Danima could die

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,240
He just wants attention. You
saw what happened in combat.

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Because of his need to
be the center of attention.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,280
Come on. We can't
let Sidmodius get away!

7
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,335
After what we've done to the Kredlers

8
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,920
It won't be long
before the humans come after us.

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
If we want our plan
to work,

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
we have to hit them where it hurts the most
.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I'll take care of the hitting.

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm talking about something much worse.

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm talking about dividing them. The.

14
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:41,656
They're here

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Remember, no hurting them.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
Especially Zak

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
They've split into two groups.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,120
I can't tell which one Sidmodius is with

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
What do we do now?

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,320
We have to split up.

21
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,135
And what will we do when we find Sidmodius?

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,560
If we're not all together.
It's too risky.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,602
Yeah, man

24
00:02:16,627 --> 00:02:17,805
She's right, Zak

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
Well, this is the Hakuru's plan

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
And it's the plan we're going to stick to.

27
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Cloe, Kiet, and Fenzy, go that way

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,391
Lon, you're coming with me

29
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,742
As you wish, Hakuru

30
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,295
Guys, we're more lost than
if we were in a nightclub.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,640
They can't be far.

32
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:21,298
There.

33
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:27,977
Yao-Sen Vision

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,760
Fenzy, block their path!

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,860
You got it!

36
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:39,063
Tai-Sen Trail

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,360
Kiet, now!

38
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,501
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Damn it!

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,384
Sidmodius isn't here

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
We have to separate him from the Yaqis!

42
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,141
Careful.

43
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,210
We can't jump over
there. It's too dangerous!

44
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:16,726
Zak! Don't do it!

45
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Vamos.

46
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,854
Damn stubborn man!

47
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Keep it up.

48
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,083
Come closer.

49
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,172
If he goes in there, we'll lose him.

50
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:33,904
I got you!

51
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
You should tie him tighter.

52
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,782
I know what I'm doing, Lon.

53
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:44,216
Sure, whatever you say.

54
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
Where's Sestrad's Chest?

55
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

56
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,995
You better tell me!

57
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,535
Or what?

58
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,655
Or we'll hand you over
to the people of Masara

59
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm sure they'll be delighted to see you.

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,156
No one in Masara knows who I am.

61
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:13,455
And you say this,
"Sidmodius" transformed us all?

62
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,320
I don't believe it.

63
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
It must be those
yellow bellied grow beards.

64
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,200
No! I think it was the Kurtacks!

65
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Nonsense!

66
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,482
It was the flumes!
Masara's crawling with those creeps.

67
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,160
And the inhabitants of this planet
are so foolish

68
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,905
that they blame each other
for the plague of Yakis!

69
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Don't look at me like that.

70
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,600
It's not my fault that
Masara doesn't have a leader

71
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,640
Someone who knows what's right

72
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Someone like him.

73
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,640
Someone who endangers the
life of his team is not a good leader.

74
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,000
I had to catch him.

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
He could have turned you into a Yaki!

76
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,320
That's what you
would have liked, right?

77
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:07,003
Then you'd be the Hakuru,
and you'd be closer to Chloe

78
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,160
Are you really going to
leave Sidmodius alone?

79
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Don't change the subject!

80
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:15,896
I saw you and Cloe
coming home the other day

81
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,646
So, is she your girlfriend?

82
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,055
Not exactly.

83
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,099
Then why on earth-

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,680
It has been a very
enjoyable visit.

85
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,960
But I have to go.

86
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
Let me go!

87
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,081
Do you really want to know
where Sestrad's Chest is?

88
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:49,533
When the fortress exploded,
Sestrad's Chest had to merge

89
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,177
With another organism to survive.

90
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,523
Now

91
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,596
I am Sestrad's Chest!

92
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,200
You're not so strong
when you're alone.

93
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,800
And trust me

94
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,010
You're very alone

95
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,120
Lon!

96
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Guys, what happened?

97
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,083
Sidmodius got away!

98
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,021
Did you have fun?

99
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,688
A lot.

100
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:15,695
I still don't understand
why I can't crush them.

101
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,600
We need them safe and sound.

102
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,362
For now.

103
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,095
I hope they're doing something very important
for us.

104
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
They will.

105
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,640
Thanks to them, the first great
tournament of Sendai will be held.

106
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,335
And then The Great Zorn will rise there.
