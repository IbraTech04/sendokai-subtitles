1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,130
and ah

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,560
yes ah it

3
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,829
seems to us that he is here he is a little

4
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,500
strange lately it is normal for him to be

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,680
upset he could die he just wants to

6
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,200
attract attention you already saw what happened

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,600
in the fight because of his damn

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,040
desire for prominence

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,950
come on we can't let him without reason

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,250
escape

11
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:10,240
after what we humans have done to the

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,899
believers in coming for

13
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:18,070
us if we want our plan to

14
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,920
follow its course we have to hit them

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,220
where it hurts the most I'm talking about something

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,710
much worse

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,409
talk about dividing them

18
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,659
and remember not to hurt them

19
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,409
especially  attack

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,909
have been divided into two groups I ca

21
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,860
n't tell which one you are in without means

22
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,259
and now what do we do we have to

23
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,330
separate and what will we do when

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,910
we find without reason if we are not

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,269
all there it is too risky place you

26
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,849
are right tag because it is the plan of the

27
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:26,380
future and it is the  we are going to continue

28
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,150
chloe quiet defense and there long to

29
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,360
be behind he took his orders and elbow

30
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,410
and

31
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,350
we are more lost than even in a

32
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,090
discotheque they can't walk very far there

33
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,910
vision

34
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,930
d little

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,870
plants

36
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,970
like god is not here

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,670
we have to separate him from the yankees be

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,680
careful

39
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,460
We can't jump over there it's too

40
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,970
dangerous

41
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,100
more pain

42
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,180
and magnitude than j

43
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,550
celina gets closer better

44
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,280
here we'll lose it

45
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,640
70 you

46
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,560
should hit it harder I know what I'm

47
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,530
doing long of course not even what you say

48
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,379
where is the box of that extra it's not

49
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,770
worth it to me  tell it

50
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,589
or we will hand you over to the other people I'm

51
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,930
sure they will be delighted to see you

52
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,650
too more now he knows who I am

53
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,210
and you say that this was the rhythm God

54
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,539
who has us 3 for dead I already believe it I'm

55
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,740
sure it was the blogs more now

56
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,789
it's  full of undesirables, the inhabitants

57
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,729
of this planet are so stupid that they

58
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,540
accuse each other of the Yaqui plague, do

59
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,980
n't look at me like that, it's not my fault that

60
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,240
it happened, there's no life, someone who knows what's

61
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,200
right, someone like him,

62
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,720

63
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,350
his team he is not a good leader he had to

64
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,360
catch him he could have become

65
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
a jackie that is what you would have

66
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,470

67
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,000

have to go a totally mold you

76
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,750

77
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,080
to survive

78
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,670
and now

79
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,910
I am the

80
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,910
strong answer when you are alone

81
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:31,070
and believe me you are  very sober

82
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,170

understand the whole game the sticks

89
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:21,390
we need them safe and sound for the moment

90
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,660
I hope they do something very important

91
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,580
for us they will do it thanks to them

92
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,940
will call the first big tournament

93
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,560
they want to play and then there will be

94
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,120
the big draw

95
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,329
