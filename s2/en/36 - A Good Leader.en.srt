1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Guys.

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't you think
Jack's been acting a little weird lately?

3
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,600
He's got every reason to be upset.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
Danny could be dead.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,120
He just wants attention.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,240
You saw what happened in combat.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Because of his damn need
to be the center of attention.

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,280
Come on.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,280
We can't let him get away.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,960
After what we've done to the Greens,

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,920
it won't be long
before the humans come after us.

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
If we want our plan
to work,

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
we have to hit them where it hurts the most
.

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
I'll take care of the hitting.

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm talking about something much worse.

16
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm talking about dividing them. The.

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,440
Seis.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,680
Bien.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Remember, no hurting them.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Especially Zack.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
They've split into two groups.

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,120
I can't tell which one he's in without models.

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,560
What do we do now?

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,320
We have to split up.

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
And what will we do when we find Sid?

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,160
God.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
If we're not all together.

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
It's too risky.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Yeah, man, you're right, Zack.

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
Well, it's the plan.

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
And it's the plan we're going to stick to.

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Chloe and Benji are over there.

33
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,440
But you're coming with me.

34
00:02:32,440
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:03,320
Oh, God.

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
We're more lost.

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,320
We're in a nightclub.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,640
They can't be far.

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
There.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,000
Get a clear view.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There they are.

42
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,080
Benji.

43
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
You can block the way.

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,760
That's done.

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,200
From Sam.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,640
¡Quieto!

47
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,600
Ahora

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I don't know anymore.

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
Damn it!

50
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,280
Sid, Morbius isn't here. No.

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880
We have to separate him from the Yaquis.

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Careful.

53
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,760
We can't jump over there.

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
It's too dangerous.

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,080
Zack.

56
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,960
¡Lo logré!

57
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Vamos.

58
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Vamos.

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:49,760
Damn stubborn thing. Oh!

60
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Keep it up.

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Come closer.

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,760
Everyone.

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
If he goes in there, we'll lose him.

64
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,680
Now. I've got you.

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
You should tie him tighter.

66
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I know what I'm doing, Lon. Sure.

67
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Whatever you say.

68
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,880
Where's that extra's box?

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

70
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
You better tell me or what?

71
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,600
Or we'll hand you over to the people in masks.

72
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm sure they'll be delighted to see you.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No one else knows who I am.

74
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
And what was that

75
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Sid Mobius who transformed us?

76
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,320
I believe it.

77
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm sure it was them, damn them.

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,200
No, I think it was the cartridges.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
No way.

80
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm sure it was the pellets.

81
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Basara is full of undesirables. No.

82
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,160
And the inhabitants of this planet
are so foolish

83
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,040
that they blame each other
for the plague of Yaquis.

84
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,480
Don't look at me like that.

85
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,600
It's not my fault that Massacre
doesn't have a leader

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,640
who knows what's right.

87
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Someone like him.

88
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Someone who endangers
the lives of his team.

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,640
He's not a good leader.

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,000
I had to catch him.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
He could have turned you into a Yaqui.

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
That's what you would have liked.

93
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,320
Right?

94
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,360
That could be you, Jacob
and you'd be closer to Chloe. Are you

95
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,160
really going to leave her like that?

96
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,960
Don't change the subject.

97
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
I saw Chloe.

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
And here, coming home the other day.

99
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,760
She's your girlfriend?

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
Not exactly.

101
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,040
Then why the hell not?

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,680
It's been a very.

103
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,960
But I have to go.

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
Don't touch me.

105
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Do you really want to know where
a house in the center is?

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,560
When the fortress exploded
and the house merged.

107
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,120
With another organism to survive.

108
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Ahora.

109
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,680
Yo soy.

110
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,680
The desperate one.

111
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,200
It's not so strong when you're alone.

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,800
And you believe it.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,400
You're very solid.

114
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,120
Everything

115
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
that's happened.

116
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Damn, he got away.

117
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,320
You had fun.

118
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
A lot.

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,360
I still don't understand
why I can't crush them.

120
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,600
We need them safe and sound.

121
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,600
For now.

122
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,000
I hope they're doing something very important
for us.

123
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
They will.

124
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
Thanks to them,

125
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,640
the first great tournament of Sendai will be held.

126
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
And then the great lord will rise there.
