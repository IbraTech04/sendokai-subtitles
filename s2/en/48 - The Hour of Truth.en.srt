1
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,607
The time has come

2
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:42,305
Evil will reign once more!

3
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,336
Good! Very good, Ona!

4
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:56,030
Hey, no! Don't do it!

5
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,330
There is energy in everything

6
00:00:59,355 --> 00:01:00,763
You have to respect them

7
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:03,871
A very wise person taught me

8
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:05,691
Her name was Danima

9
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,589
And I wish I could
have saved her

10
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:10,614
Anyways

11
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:13,970
Now the only thing
I can do for her

12
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,971
is to be a good Hakuru
and beat Sidmodius

13
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,630
Look who we have here!

14
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:26,124
You're staying in
this dimension today.

15
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,059
Kiet!

16
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,825
It can't be that you're always
lying around doing nothing!

17
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,919
Come on, get up!

18
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:43,576
Who are you talking to, Grandma?

19
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,030
That's the microwave...

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,936
Okay, see you later!

21
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:59,994
If this is the microwave, then
where did I put the lasagna?

22
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,638
"Hang up the sheets"

23
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,078
I'm a Sendokai warrior!

24
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:13,810
I can't imagine the Masters
of Fire doing the laundry

25
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,543
Mom! We can't hang
the sheets! It's gonna rain

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,952
How odd... The weatherman
said there'd be sun

27
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm leaving, what's left?

28
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm leaving to hang
out with the guys!

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,057
Have fun!

30
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,504
By the way, Mom.

31
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,833
Remember that the problem about
the trains I was telling you about?

32
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:08,450
Yes

33
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:10,341
You were right

34
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,041
The driver has already
chosen his divine destination

35
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,258
Citizens of Masara!

36
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,708
Please take your seats!

37
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:34,968
In a few hours, the great Sendokai
Tournament finals will begin!

38
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,920
Today's the big day!

39
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:49,770
We can finally defeat sidmodius!

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,370
But first

41
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:56,288
I want to say that I am very
happy to fight with you guys again

42
00:03:56,327 --> 00:04:00,116
I know that as long as we're
together, nothing can stop us!

43
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:03,942
But what about Lon?

44
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,077
When he disappeared,
he was crazy!

45
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,610
We have to find him and help him

46
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,825
But we can't do it until
the tournament is over

47
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,789
There is another
issue that worries me...

48
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:19,014
To win, we need
the Nero-Sen fusion

49
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,022
How did you and the
Kiwuns manage to activate it?

50
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:25,136
Yeah! How did you
find your common goal?

51
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:26,211
It was strange.

52
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:29,078
I think it wasn't so
much <i>what</i> we shared

53
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,110
but <i>how</i> we shared it, as

54
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:34,628
It's like we all
wanted the same thing

55
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,561
But each in our own way.

56
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,252
Ah, okay!

57
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:41,344
I don't get it

58
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,677
I think what we shared was a...

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
...a feeling

60
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:50,969
So we have to
train.... our feelings?

61
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,267
I'm afraid that's not possible

62
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:58,375
But I'm sure it's something
we'll figure out as we fight!

63
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,315
...Or so I hope

64
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,639
The moment of truth has arrived!

65
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,025
Masarianos!

66
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,306
I regret to inform you that you
may not see any combat today

67
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:30,385
Sometimes my rivals feel
intimidated and don't show up

68
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,181
when I am your leader, I promise
to always stand up to our enemies!

69
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:43,640
I will defend us from the
tyrants and the wicked!

70
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,877
If they don't arrive
before the countdown

71
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,468
They will be disqualified!

72
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,493
Ragnaki!

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Ragnaki!

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
Ragnaki!

75
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,030
Ragnaki!

76
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:01,607
Ragnaki!

77
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,952
Zack, about what you said.

78
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,693
I was thinking....

79
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,933
We have a feeling in common

80
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,958
Because....

81
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:16,595
I think..... I feel something

82
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:20,968
Chloe. To be honest-

83
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,820
That's not important right now

84
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,203
To activate the fusion

85
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:29,851
We need a feeling
that the four of us share

86
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:32,026
Not just you and I

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,725
Do you agree?

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
I agree

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
What is that?!

90
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,541
Yakis! They're invading earth!

91
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,389
Dang it!

92
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:05,934
We can't leave now!

93
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:09,366
But if we don't leave
now, we will be disqualified

94
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:13,350
And Sidmodius will win
the great tournament!

95
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,054
There's still time

96
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,716
I don't like this

97
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,317
Me neither

98
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,212
Where's the team?

99
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,513
The lengths people
go to find parking

100
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,474
I'm sorry! Did I
mess up your hair?

101
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:25,592
That's right...

102
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,226
Fight the Yankis!

103
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,217
And forget about the tournament

104
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,345
There's too many of them!

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Careful!

106
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Tampo!

107
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,269
What are you doing here?

108
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:01,219
You should be
winning a tournament!

109
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,869
We can't leave you here alone

110
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,979
Respect, young man!

111
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,907
These geezers know
how to defend themselves

112
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,067
The brothers fight together
again like the good old days

113
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,694
Let's see who takes
out the most Yakis!

114
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:05,690
it is clear that they are
not going to show up

115
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,729
Well in that case.... I
declare the Baron Ragnaki

116
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Hault!

117
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,467
This farce comes to
an end, Sidmodius.

118
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:29,344
The fury of all those you
harmed will fall upon you today.
