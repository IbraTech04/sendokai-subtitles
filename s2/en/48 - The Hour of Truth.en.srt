tell you that I am very happy  to fight

by your side again I know that as long as we

are together nothing will stop us

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,180
was like talking we have to find

56
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,000
him and help him but we can't do it

We will need the fusion but I know how

60
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,560
you managed to free it, the kings, some

62
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,840
common goal. It was strange. I think it

63
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,960
wasn't so much what we shared but how

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,110
we shared it, as

65
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,440
if we all wanted the same thing but

66
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,870
each one in their own way,

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,150
okay, I do

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,430
n't get it.  I think what we shared

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,200
was a feeling

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,690
so we will have to train

we'll find as we fight or

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,160
