1
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Oh! Oh!

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Oh! Sam.

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Hello. Ah!

4
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,960
Oh! Oh! Oh!

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh! Oh!

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Oh! Oh!

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,520
Look at you!

8
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,160
You look handsome.

9
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Hey. Are you laughing at me?

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,720
After
all the trouble I've caused?

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I guess I deserve it.

12
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:40,080
Oh. No, no, no.

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh. Lightning

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
on you.

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Disparo.

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Se. ¡Oh,

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Damn it!

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
I could have made you a Jackie.

19
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,520
That's what you would have liked.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,040
Right? It could be.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,520
You, the Kuru, and closer to Chloe.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Why the hell would I do that?

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,120
You'd use a ponytail.

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,320
You're very.

25
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Oh, God.

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Yes. My God.

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,480
It got away.

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,400
My. Ri.

29
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,440
I've failed everyone who trusted me.

30
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,840
But you can't blame me for anything.

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
Come with me if you want, but with your mouth

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,440
shut.

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I heard you.

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't wait for you to start the tournament.

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,720
You'll see when they see me
come in on my feet.

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,240
Here.

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
The Yankees won't be going to the tournament.

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
What?

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
Remember, it's happened
every time the boys have faced

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,840
them.

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
This tie is.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Sam fired.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Nothing.

45
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
Damn humans.

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
You mustn't hate them.

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Thanks to them
the great tournament has been called for today.

48
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Now you just have to win
the great tournament.

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,160
Gain the trust of the most Aryan.

50
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,440
Wait until they are eating
out of the palm of your hand.

51
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,320
And then you'll become the Great Fox.

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,280
A new beginning for a new empire.

53
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
And what will happen to the Yankees?

54
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,440
For now, they'll stay here.

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I have other plans for them.

56
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,560
Without Mobius and Kronos.

57
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
They used us to carry out their plan.

58
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,480
If the boys haven't traveled to another
dimension.

59
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
They've traveled through time.

60
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Exactly.

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,680
It's not just Earth in the past.

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
According to legend,

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Masada was plunged into chaos
until a leader emerged

64
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,760
capable of uniting
all its peoples under the Great Sun.

65
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,760
If you have left the past behind, it is because without God

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,760
wants to become the great one.

67
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
There is only one way to stop you and

68
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,520
destroy everything.

69
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
By winning the grand tournament.

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,960
If we fail without Mobius,

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
he'll become the Great Orb.

72
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
What if we let God win?

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It can't be worse than the Marshal.

74
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,920
Hey!

75
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,920
We'll never make it.

76
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,840
Hey, don't talk like that.

77
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,440
Think
of all the battles we've won

78
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
and the powers we've gained.

79
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Armor from.

80
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Are yours.

81
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,680
The strength, The.

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Alone.

83
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
The wall.

84
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,280
All of them.

85
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,680
And now we have the armor.

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,680
But you'll see
when we unleash the fusion.

87
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
But, sir.

88
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,200
Mero.

89
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Make that 100. 130.

90
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,080
Oh. It's armor.

91
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,040
We can win, and we will win.

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
We are still four warriors
without Tokai.

93
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,840
We are strong,

94
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
fast

95
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,200
and very clever. Yes.

96
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,720
That's true.

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,480
But we lost our agreement.

98
00:09:19,480
Forget about the one who abandoned you.

99
00:09:27,600
I can be your shield.

100
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Then say no more.

101
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
We have a tournament to win. Yes.

102
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,360
Did you notice that? Yes.

103
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
There's something strange about that kid's energy.
104

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:60,00
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,160
We have to find Zack.

105
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Oh, damn it.

106
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Donkey just brings me trouble.

107
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,560
Ah, look.

108
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,560
You've found a friend.

109
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
He reminds me of someone.

110
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
We could go to the movies together.

111
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Cool.

112
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,960
What you said about going to the movies.

113
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
It's still on. Mmm.

114
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,680
Me decías.

115
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
Nada.

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Forget it.

117
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,520
Hey, this is no time for laughing.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,120
It's in the past. And that's it.

119
00:11:15,120
By the way, this is for you.

120
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Nada.

121
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,720
Olvídala.

122
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,760
We have each other.

123
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,840
We don't need anyone else.
