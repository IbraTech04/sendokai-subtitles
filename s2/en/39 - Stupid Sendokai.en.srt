1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,520
Look at you!

2
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,160
You look handsome.

3
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Hey. Are you laughing at me?

4
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,720
After all the trouble I've
caused, I guess I deserve it.

5
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,035
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

6
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,803
Zet Sen Shot

7
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,241
Damn it!

8
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
He could have made you a Yaki!

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,177
You would've liked that, right?

10
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:32,655
It could be you, the
Hakuru, and closer to Chloe.

11
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Why the hell would I do that?

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,120
I'm Sestrad's Chest!

13
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,827
You're very alone

14
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,631
Sidmodius got away

15
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,361
I've failed everyone who trusted me.

16
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,840
But you can't blame me for anything.

17
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:26,163
Come with me if you want,
but with your mouth shut.

18
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,436
I heard that

19
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,036
I can't wait for the tournament.

20
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:45,700
I can't wait to see their faces
when I come in with my Yakis!

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
The Yakis won't be
going to the tournament.

22
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
What?

23
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,841
Remember what happened every
time the Senkuns have faced them.

24
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,896
Tai-Sen Trail!

25
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,896
Zet-Sen Shot!

26
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,044
Yes!

27
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:48,215
Damn humans.

28
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
You mustn't hate them.

29
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Thanks to them the Great Sendokai
Tournament has been called for today.

30
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:00,215
Now you just have to win
the great tournament.

31
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,160
Gain the trust of the Masarians

32
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,055
Wait until they are eating
out of the palm of your hand.

33
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,320
And then you'll become the <i>Great Zorn</i>

34
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,280
A new beginning for a new empire.

35
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
And what will happen to the Yakis?

36
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,440
For now, they'll stay here.
I have other plans for them.

37
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:40,877
Sidmodius and Chronam-Yatt
used us to carry out their plan

38
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,095
Sidmodius and the Senkuns
haven't traveled to another dimension.

39
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
They've traveled through time!

40
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Exactly.

41
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,975
Masara is Earth, in the past.

42
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,621
According to a legend,
Masara was plunged into chaos

43
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:13,749
until a leader emerged
capable of uniting all its people

44
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:16,366
The Great Zorn

45
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:24,767
Sidmodius time-travelled because he wants to become The Great Zorn

46
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:35,520
There is only one way to stop Sidmodius;
Destroy Sestrad's Chest

47
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
By winning the grand tournament.

48
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,415
If we fail, Sidmodius will
become the Great Zorn

49
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,345
What if we let Sidmodius win?
It can't be worse than the Marshal.

50
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,064
We'll never make it.

51
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,840
Hey, don't talk like that.

52
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,509
Think of all the battles we've
won and the powers we've gained.

53
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,440
Ignis Armor are yours.

54
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,196
Duo-Sen Force

55
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,117
Yeah!

56
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Duo-Sen Wall

57
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,017
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt

58
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,183
And now we have Nero Armor

59
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,542
You'll see
when we unleash the Nero-Sen Fusion

60
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:28,528
Nero-At-Sen

61
00:08:36,754 --> 00:08:38,676
Sen-Do-Kai!

62
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,187
It's Nero armor.

63
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,040
We can win, and we will win.

64
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,240
We are still four Sendokai warriors!

65
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:05,651
We are strong,

66
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:06,745
fast

67
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,338
and very clever

68
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:11,495
Yes

69
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,720
That's true.

70
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,480
But we lost our Hakuru

71
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:22,620
Forget about the one who abandoned you!

72
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:30,198
I can be your Hakuru!

73
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,534
Then say no more. We
have a tournament to win!

74
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,874
Yeah!

75
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,312
Did you notice that?

76
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,437
Yes. There's something
strange about that kid's energy.

77
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,780
We have to find Zack.

78
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,646
Stupid Sendokai!

79
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,640
Only brings me problems

80
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,527
Ah, look.

81
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,991
You've found a friend.

82
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,649
He reminds me of someone.

83
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
We could go to the movies together.

84
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,430
Cool.

85
00:10:55,992 --> 00:11:00,633
What you said about going to the movies...
Is that still on?

86
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:03,429
What were you saying?

87
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,945
Nothing, forget it

88
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:11,570
Hey, this is no time for laughing.

89
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,867
I really enjoyed that

90
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,109
Me too

91
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,351
By the way, this is for you.

92
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,840
Forget her We have each
other. We don't need anyone else.
