homework problem

I can help you

54
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,489
explain that problem to me because there is a train

55
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,280
that leaves a city at 150 kilometers

per hour

57
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,620
and the train can go to two cities in  One I

58
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,129
see myself as an

59
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,000
interesting and sensitive girl

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,930
and in the other there lives a very funny boy

61
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,780
who is a bit of a disaster but the very

62
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,220
good one in the entire universe. I don't understand the

63
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,310
question will follow which path

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,520
the train should choose. I suppose that at some point during the

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
journey the driver  You will know where you

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,150
really want to go, you just have to

67
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,960
follow your feelings. I don't know what

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,030
the passengers will think of this system.

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,290
If the heart chooses the destination, believe me, there

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,820
will be no better trip

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,530
you, being named a leader is easy, the difficult thing
