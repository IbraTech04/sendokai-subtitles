1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Bravo. You've become
a very dangerous warrior

2
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,445
But remember

3
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:03,414
Winning the tournament
isn't enough to take control

4
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,210
You have to win over the audience

5
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,764
Win over the audience?

6
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:13,397
First, you must show yourself vulnerable

7
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,766
Pretend that you are in danger

8
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,674
The audience will sympathize with you

9
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:22,216
And when they think that all is lost

10
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:28,778
We will give an unexpected twist
to the situation with a final surprise.

11
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:31,653
They will not see you as a warrior,

12
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,419
But as a hero

13
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,809
A hero?

14
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,872
I like it

15
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:46,918
Kiet!

16
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:50,962
Get up! I need you to help
me move a piece of furniture

17
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,330
Five more minutes

18
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,295
No!

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,169
It has to be done now

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,166
I'm tired

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,917
I haven't seen you this tired in a while!

22
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,000
More or less...

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,505
Since you fought those monsters

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,688
Like the last time

25
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:21,009
It's very important that no one on
earth knows about the big tournament

26
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,710
It could cause panic

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,735
Moving furniture? I
love moving furniture!

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,130
Do you want me to take
the wardrobe up to the roof?

29
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:39,653
This Sendokai thing is going to finish me!

30
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,225
Fenzi, darling!

31
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,384
I'm going to get a massage with rose petal oils

32
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,088
and I was wondering if you'd like to join,
you know, a girls' afternoon, a massage

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,799
A massage?

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,328
Maybe it would be good for me.

35
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay!

36
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,040
massage with rose petals? Something's wrong with you. It's

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,790
not that now I'm in trouble at the Royo

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,520
Poor's and things with

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,709
strawberry flowers, I'm crazy here, joy, my daughter, and you

40
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,840
'll see how late we're both going to spend

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,110
together and

42
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,770
or

43
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,030
chloe are you fine well well I

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,829
'm in a mess with a

45
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,530
homework problem

46
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,290
I can help you

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,489
explain that problem to me because there is a train

48
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,280
that leaves a city at 150 kilometers

49
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,180
per hour

50
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,620
and the train can go to two cities in  One I

51
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,129
see myself as an

52
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:06,000
interesting and sensitive girl

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,930
and in the other there lives a very funny boy

54
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,780
who is a bit of a disaster but the very

55
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,220
good one in the entire universe. I don't understand the

56
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,310
question will follow which path

57
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,520
the train should choose. I suppose that at some point during the

58
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,400
journey the driver  You will know where you

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,150
really want to go, you just have to

60
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,960
follow your feelings. I don't know what

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,030
the passengers will think of this system.

62
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,290
If the heart chooses the destination, believe me, there

63
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,820
will be no better trip

64
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,300
lol. Do you

65
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,120
remember that I found a group of

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,090
friends

67
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,250
because they have named me the leader of the

68
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,370
gang?  Now I am a boss like

69
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,530
you, being named a leader is easy, the difficult thing

70
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,949
is to stay

71
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,190
thanks to me, my company is a leader in the

72
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,100
five continents, but I am surrounded by

73
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,260
a lot of hyenas who want to steal my

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,080
place,

75
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,110
I am going to my room, be careful, long

76
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,419
your  True enemies are not your

77
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,970
adversaries, but those who are by your side

78
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,620
will want to take away what is yours, we

79
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,469
are already here. Have you remembered to give

80
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,989
dinner to your sister? If she has already done it

81
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:50,289
very well, now you just need to pick up

82
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,749
her toys from the living room too.  He has

83
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,689
done it, wow, how responsible you have

84
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,830
suddenly become, you find that you won't be

85
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,769
saving the world again, don't

86
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,739
worry about it,

87
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:10,019
good night, good night

88
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,380
and since this,

89
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,920
I'm for

90
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,460
a different tournament but there

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
open the floodgates

92
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,520
the map

93
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,580
how strange that one is passing

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,970
a silence please

95
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,569
and

96
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,779
in the center today they will face the

97
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,060
plan

98
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,260
and not

99
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,699
because they booed it this is fed by

100
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,400
the crops of the most  There they pass us

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,759
the fields and cause common famines they

102
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,680
play the great tournament we have a problem

103
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,320
in this fight it is not going to end well in

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,180
any way it was

105
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,190
making streets

106
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:24,000
yes you

107
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,910
but ours does not react

108
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,360
this is  releasing a bunch of

109
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,079
insects

110
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,400
it seems that it is not

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,210
celebrating crusaders

112
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,300
my mother

113
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,380
because to live

114
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,170
3

115
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,120
my son lives

116
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,319
a child has just fallen into the field

117
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,939
insects

118
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:31,169
we have to save him

119
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,700
the sea or in rne no one has just saved

120
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,139
with a child

121
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:43,560
victor manipulator

122
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,830
the man here not only  has won but

123
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,610
