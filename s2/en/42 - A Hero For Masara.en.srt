1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Bravo. You've become
a very dangerous warrior

2
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,445
But remember

3
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:03,414
Winning the tournament
isn't enough to take control

4
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,210
You have to win over the audience

5
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,764
Win over the audience?

6
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:13,397
First, you must show yourself vulnerable

7
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,766
Pretend that you are in danger

8
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,674
The audience will sympathize with you

9
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:22,216
And when they think that all is lost

10
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:28,778
We will give an unexpected twist
to the situation with a final surprise.

11
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:31,653
They will not see you as a warrior,

12
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,419
But as a hero

13
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:34,809
A hero?

14
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,872
I like it

15
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:46,918
Kiet!

16
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:50,962
Get up! I need you to help
me move a piece of furniture

17
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,330
Five more minutes

18
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,295
No!

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,169
It has to be done now

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,166
I'm tired

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,917
I haven't seen you this tired in a while!

22
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,000
More or less...

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,505
Since you fought those monsters

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,688
Like the last time

25
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:21,009
It's very important that no one on
earth knows about the big tournament

26
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:22,710
It could cause panic

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,735
Moving furniture? I
love moving furniture!

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,130
Do you want me to take
the wardrobe up to the roof?

29
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:39,653
This Sendokai thing is going to finish me!

30
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,225
Fenzi, darling!

31
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,384
I'm going to get a massage with rose petal oils

32
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,088
and I was wondering if you'd like to join,
you know, a girls' afternoon, a massage

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,799
A massage?

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,328
Maybe it would be good for me.

35
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:01,582
Okay!

36
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,747
It's not like you to want
a rose petal massage

37
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:06,015
Is something wrong?

38
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,091
Uh, no. It's just that

39
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:11,589
I'm really into the whole
cheesy stuff now

40
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,072
And flowery things, like
strawberry-scented stuff

41
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,158
I love it!

42
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:22,101
What joy, my daughter. You'll see what a
great afternoon we're going to have together!

43
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,186
Chloe, are you okay?

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
Yeah

45
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,939
Well, I'm confused about
a problem....

46
00:03:43,964 --> 00:03:45,333
A homework problem!

47
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,556
Oh, I can help you with that!

48
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,087
So, explain that problem to me

49
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:55,926
Well, there's a train that
leaves a city at 115km/h

50
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,650
And the train can go to two cities

51
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:05,304
A very interesting and
sensitive boy lives in one city

52
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:10,244
And in the other there
lives a very funny boy

53
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,266
who is a bit of a mess, but the
kindest in the whole universe

54
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,942
I see

55
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:21,596
The question is: Which
path should the train choose?

56
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:28,310
I suppose at some point in the journey,
the driver will know where they want to go.

57
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,969
They just have to follow their feelings

58
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,656
I don't know what the
passengers will think of this system

59
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:40,103
If the heart chooses the
destination, believe me

60
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:42,863
There will be no better trip

61
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:49,430
Dad?

62
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:50,847
Lon?

63
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,753
Remember that group of friends I found?

64
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,188
Well, they've named me leader of the gang.

65
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:05,844
Now I'm a boss like you!

66
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,930
It's easy being named a leader

67
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,875
The hard part is staying

68
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,961
Thanks to me, my company
is a leader on five continents

69
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:24,055
But I'm surrounded by a bunch of
hyenas who want to steal my place!

70
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,078
I am going to my room

71
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,657
Be careful, Lon

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,186
Your true enemies are not your adversaries,
but those who are by your side.

73
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,016
They will want to take away what is yours.

74
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,593
We're here! Did you remember
to give your sister dinner?

75
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:46,883
Yes, I did.

76
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:52,266
Very good. Well, now we just have
to pick up her toys from the living room

77
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,391
 I've done that too.

78
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:57,305
Wow! You've become quite
responsible all of a sudden.

79
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,572
Are you okay?

80
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:02,322
You're not saving the world again, are you?

81
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,924
No, don't worry about that.

82
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:06,900
Good night!

83
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,197
Good night!

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,900
We have the winners of the first phase.

85
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Yes!

86
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,515
So, as the master of ceremonies

87
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,939
I'm putting on the second phase
of the Great Sendokai Tournament!

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Great!

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,127
Open the floodgates

90
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,882
The map!

91
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:27,489
How weird

92
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,841
What's going on?

93
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,662
Silence, please.

94
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:47,076
In today's Sendokai, The Baron
Ragnaki and Nasto will face off!

95
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:54,545
Why are they "boo"ing him?

96
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,537
Nasto feeds on the Masarian's crops

97
00:07:57,826 --> 00:08:01,388
They devastate the fields and cause famines

98
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:05,185
If Nasto wins the Grand
Tournament, we will have a problem

99
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,320
It's not going to end well either way

100
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,601
Let the Sendokai begin!

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,935
The Baron takes the do and
runs towards the Senrock!

102
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:32,349
But Nasto doesn't react!

103
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,584
Move, slug!

104
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,443
By Flor's drool! Nasto's
releasing a lot of insects!

105
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Damn it!

106
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,248
Kai for Nasto!

107
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Out!

108
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,666
The Baron fights back!

109
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,470
Kai for the Baron Ragnaki!

110
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,840
He's pretending!

111
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:49,385
He's not like that!

112
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,291
It seems that Nasto is
not going to be crossed.

113
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,300
My mother!

114
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,665
He just released a giant insect.

115
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,384
My son! Where is my son!

116
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:21,977
A child has just fallen into the field

117
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
My son!

118
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,939
Oh no! The insect is heading towards him!

119
00:10:27,939 --> 00:10:29,469
We have to save him

120
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:43,887
The Baron Ragnaki just saved the child!

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
Unbelievable!

122
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,712
He's crossing the field with a child

123
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,595
Sid-Sen Energy!

124
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,606
Double-Kai!

125
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,364
It's the end of the fight!

126
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,973
Damn manipulator

127
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:46,387
The Baron Ragnaki has not only won

128
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:50,005
But has heroically saved a child's life!

129
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,761
Thank you very much baron

130
00:11:53,786 --> 00:12:00,113
Ragnaki!

131
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,747
a hero

132
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,725
has become a bad hero.
