1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Great shot master. I swear
your aim gets better every day!

2
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,881
That is enough Sidmodius
a level one Yaki is sufficient

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,265
I want more energy

4
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,292
You must use Sestrad's chest in moderation
until you can control it

5
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,850
I need to be stronger!

6
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,466
so how do we get to this new
dimension Tanpo was talking about?

7
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,659
Ask him. That's where he's from.

8
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,601
Take me to your leader! I demand an explanation

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,988
I have modified the portal.
It will now transport you

10
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:14,000
to the dimension where
Kronum-Yatt, My sister is.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,486
Be careful! I know Sidmodius
and He will do anything

12
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,000
to prevent you from
destroying the chest!

13
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,843
He will have many Yakis
to protect him. Remember:

14
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:30,161
To defeat them. You must
strike their energy centers.

15
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:33,286
You mean, you're not coming?

16
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:58,000
No. We have another mission. There is something mysterious about this whole affair. And I want to
investigate but you must not be afraid. Or Sindo chi warrior is never alone. As long as they have a team

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hold out your arm and yell send Yo Kai

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:42,000
right

19
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
my body it's changed

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
it's the wristband you'll get used to it

21
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Welcome to my planet

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
guys, look

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the sorne fortress

24
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
looks like it transported here before it exploded.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is that thing yours? You humans have no idea how to park a ship.

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And what's that?

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The home of Dan Nima High Priestess of the center this is where my brothers Keenan and keyway we're doing this send a chi training is the priestess.

28
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have sent a chi here to of

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
course, to the people of Massara. Nothing is more important than send a chi. We resolve all our conflicts on the field.

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, you're in luck because the king of Send okay just rolled into town

31
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:26,000
oh yeah well in the school yard yesterday the king of Shindo chi stood there like a statute Good thing I reacted in time

32
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I did not just stand there I was a headwind

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:50,000
maybe this team needs a leader with better reflexes Did you hear that

34
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I recognize that smell it's it's

35
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:32,000
aim for their heads

36
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
looks like that's not gonna do it

37
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
not their heads

38
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:48,000
remember to defeat them you must strike their energy centers

39
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you got to hit them in their energy center fenzi surround them with a Tyson trail.

40
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you talking about?

41
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Benzie

42
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
keep shooting

43
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Tyson

44
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Chloe what's their next move gonna be

45
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
yeah

46
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the one in the middle is going to jump kit. I need a platform

47
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
said saying shocked

48
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
yes

49
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
they're getting away

50
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,000
good work

51
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
oh, it's an old lady. Oh, High Priestess.

52
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where are your manners? It's done NEMA on your knees.

53
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Uh, who are you? What happened to me?

54
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We are sendo chi warriors from Planet Earth. You got turned into a yucky.

55
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I remember. We were training when this ship fell out of the sky. We went to investigate. And we were hit by someone whose heart was full of darkness.

56
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Said modius.

57
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I priestess. The other Yankees with a

58
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
yes. Your brother's? Hey,

59
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
don't sweat it. We'll find them. Even if we have to search the whole of Massara.

60
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If that is your intention, you will need help. Which of you is the Haku rule. Who is the leader of this tea? Is it you? Or you?

61
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think it's me.

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In that case, take this activated

63
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It is a matter of Massara as her quarrel, it is your responsibility to carry it and guide the others. A hawk who must always remain with his team, through good times. And through bad. Thank

64
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you. We'll give Sid modius what he deserves.

65
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You must be careful. The Yankees you have seen so far, we're not especially powerful. But Sid modius will grow stronger. Creating higher level Yankees.

66
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't worry. ascendo codewarrior is never alone. As long as they have a T

67
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:47,000
shirt humans Why must they always interfere? Relax, great master. I bet it's just a coincidence

68
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't worry about the humans. I sent a Yaquis to Earth to attract their attention.

69
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And why did you do that? They

70
00:11:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to a part of the plan.
