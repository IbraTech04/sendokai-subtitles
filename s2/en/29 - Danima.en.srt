1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,141
Great shot, master!

2
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,975
I swear, your aim gets better every day!

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,190
That is enough, Sidmodius.

4
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:12,927
A level one Yaki is sufficient

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,265
I want more energy

6
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,292
You must use Sestrad's chest in moderation
until you can control it

7
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:30,850
I need to be stronger!

8
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,466
So, how do we get to this new
dimension Tanpo was talking about?

9
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:47,661
Ask him

10
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,355
 That's where he's from.

11
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,413
Take me to your leader!

12
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:53,373
I demand an explanation!

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,988
I have modified the portal.
It will now transport you

14
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:14,000
to the dimension where
Chronam-Yatt, my sister is.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,486
Be careful! I know Sidmodius
and He will do anything

16
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,000
to prevent you from
destroying the chest!

17
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,843
He will have many Yakis
to protect him. Remember:

18
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:30,161
To defeat them. You must
strike their energy centers.

19
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:33,286
You mean, you're not coming?

20
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,891
No. We have another mission.

21
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,606
There is something mysterious about this whole affair.

22
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:42,642
And I want to investigate

23
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,601
But you must not be afraid!

24
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:50,668
A Sendokai warrior is never alone!

25
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:52,881
As long as they have a team

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,726
Hold out your arm and yell "Sendokai"!

27
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,575
Sendokai!

28
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:45,326
My body! It's... changed!

29
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:49,639
it's the wristband. You'll get used to it

30
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:56,035
Welcome to my planet!

31
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,955
Masara!

32
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,249
Guys, look!

33
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:13,114
The Zorn Fortress!

34
00:04:15,378 --> 00:04:19,001
Looks like it transported
here before it exploded.

35
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,267
Is that thing yours?

36
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:25,708
You humans have no idea how to park a ship!

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And what's that?

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,502
The home of Danima!
High Priestess of the Sen!

39
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,806
This is where my brothers,
Keenan and Keeway,

40
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:43,976
Were doing their Sendokai
Training with the priestess.

41
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,000
You have Sendokai here, too?

42
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,424
Of course!

43
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:53,217
To the people of Massara, nothing
is more important than Sendokai!

44
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:56,286
We resolve all our conflicts on the field.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,510
Well, you're in luck!

46
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:02,523
Because the king of
Sendokai just rolled into town

47
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,426
Oh yeah?

48
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:14,581
Well, in the school yard
yesterday, the "king of Sendokai"

49
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:19,124
Stood there like a statue.
Good thing I reacted in time

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,388
I did not just stand there! I was- uh

51
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:31,300
Aheadwind!

52
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:36,679
Maybe this team needs a
leader with better reflexes

53
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,646
Shh!

54
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:40,767
Did you hear that?!

55
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,556
I recognize that smell!

56
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:54,734
It's.... It's...

57
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:57,686
Yakis!

58
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,776
Aim for their heads!

59
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:31,975
Uh oh...

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,120
Looks like that's not gonna do it!

61
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:37,000
...Not their heads

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,357
Remember: To defeat them you
must strike their energy centers

63
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,388
You gotta hit them in their energy center!

64
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,829
Fenzi! Surround them with a Tai-Sen Trail!

65
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you talking about?

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,016
Fenzi! Keep shooting!

67
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,023
Tai-Sen Trail!

68
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,904
Cloe! What's their next move gonna be?

69
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,650
Yao-Sen Vision!

70
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,497
The one in the middle is going to jump!

71
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:32,230
Kiet! I need a platform!

72
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,986
Coa-Sen Shield!

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,741
Zet-Sen Shot!

74
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,932
Yes!

75
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:10,798
Hey! They're getting away!

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,399
Good work!

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,570
Oh! It's an old lady!

78
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,975
Oh, High Priestess!

79
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,015
Where are your manners? It's Danima!

80
00:08:39,326 --> 00:08:40,771
On your knees!

81
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,523
Who are you?

82
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,543
What happened to me?

83
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:52,991
We are Sendokai warriors from Planet Earth.

84
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,212
You got turned into a Yaki

85
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:56,606
Yes

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,844
I remember

87
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,533
We were training when
this ship fell out of the sky.

88
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,183
We went to investigate.
And we were attacked

89
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:12,892
by someone whose
heart was full of darkness.

90
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,000
Sidmodius!

91
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I priestess. The other Yakis! Were they-

92
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes. Your brothers.

93
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,342
Hey! Don't sweat it!

94
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,901
We'll find them!

95
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,976
Even if we have to search
the whole of Massara!

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,065
If that is your intention, you
will need help. Which of you is

97
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,798
the Hakuru?

98
00:09:38,606 --> 00:09:42,198
 Who is the leader of this team?

99
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:44,498
Is it you?

100
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:46,198
Or you?

101
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,886
Uh

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,665
I think it's me.

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,034
In that case, take this

104
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:00,011
Activate it

105
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,257
Woah!

106
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:11,786
It is a map of Massara!

107
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:19,153
As Hakuru, it is your responsibility
to carry it and guide the others.

108
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:24,453
A Hakuru must always remain with his team,

109
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:29,719
Through good times, and through bad

110
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:30,800
Thank you.

111
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:33,737
We'll give Sidmodius what he deserves.

112
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:36,287
You must be careful!

113
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:41,787
The Yakis you have seen so
far were not especially powerful.

114
00:10:42,366 --> 00:10:45,760
But Sidmodius will grow stronger.

115
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:48,932
Creating higher level Yankees.

116
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,347
Don't worry!

117
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,034
A Sendokai warrior is never
alone.

118
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,223
As long as they have a team!

119
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:19,371
Curse those humans!

120
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:23,360
Why must they always interfere?

121
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:28,634
Relax, great master. I
bet it's just a coincidence

122
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,846
And the humans-

123
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:49,800
Don't worry about the humans.

124
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:54,367
I sent a Yaqi to Earth
to attract their attention.

125
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,975
And why did you do that?

126
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,847
They too, are apart of the plan
