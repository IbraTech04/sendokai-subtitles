1
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,955
Guys, I got it!

2
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,375
Magnus said that to
activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,800
We had to find a common goal, right?

4
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,339
Well, our goal is to defeat
Sidmodius! So let's think about him.

5
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,183
Nero-Sen Fusion!

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Nothing

7
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,892
It's not working

8
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,296
Guys, this whole "exploding
every five minutes" isn't cool

9
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:36,031
Yeah. Finding a common
goal is very difficult

10
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,664
I don't know if I'll
be able to do it

11
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,499
Relax, we just need to rest

12
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:41,840
Rest?

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,735
That I know how to do.
I'm the Hakuru of resting.

14
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:56,284
I also envied my brother
for thousands of years

15
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,135
I know you'd like to be with them

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,540
Be their Hakuru

17
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:06,893
But if you really care about
them, it's best to stay away.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,926
I'm here!

19
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,770
Whose suitcase is this? Mom's?

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
They're mine.

21
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm leaving

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,349
The company is doing very badly in the East

23
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,746
I have to go and take care of it personally

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,775
What?

25
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,793
How long will you be gone?

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,272
I don't know

27
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:41,159
But I'll deposit money for
you. You won't miss anything.

28
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,606
I don't care about the damn money

29
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,399
You can't buy me like one of your lackeys!

30
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:51,882
I won't allow you to speak to me like that.

31
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:57,239
You're abandoning me like mom did! You're worse than her!

32
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,050
Lon!

33
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,414
Are you okay? If you need to talk, you know you can trust me

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,582
Yeah, I'm fine

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,140
the next one is falling

36
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,810
really exists, you have a group of inma

37
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,450
shara, the mothers tell their children

38
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,719
that if they don't behave well,

39
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,489
then there it will come and give them

40
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,239
nightmares. It

41
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,950
gives me chills that

42
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,069
the center starts

43
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,079
making streets

44
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,610
the rabbit the humans

45
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,820
and I say that under the mask you are

46
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,030
wearing

47
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,750
what is this I don't feel well

48
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,080
but it has no mass

49
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,539
and that fog is using their fears to

50
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,809
cause hallucinations the humans

51
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,789
are  behaving strangely

52
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,569
chloe

53
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,280

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,950

56
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,560
I wish I didn't have things that threw away my

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,780
life

58
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,220

99
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,350
the woman who accompanies himself God

100
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,350
is not a simple chronicle

101
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,590
she and her sister were created by the

102
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,140
gods of being to maintain  the

103
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,360
balance of good and evil in the

104
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,880
multiverse krona yang is a goddess of

105
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,810
evil that is absurd

106
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,220
but true

107
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,730
when you defeated the Thorne empire

108
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,360
you tipped the scales and good triumphed

109
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,760
now my sister wants to return the

110
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,500
multiverse to darkness

111
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,130
that god  It is her puppet,

112
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,890
she may have no ways, but

113
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,760
we have

114
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,960
each other, I have been told with

115
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,470
age

116
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,160
and
