1
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:38,955
Guys, I got it!

2
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,375
Magnus said that to
activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,800
We had to find a common goal, right?

4
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,339
Well, our goal is to defeat
Sidmodius! So let's think about him.

5
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,183
Nero-Sen Fusion!

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Nothing

7
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,892
It's not working

8
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,296
Guys, this whole "exploding
every five minutes" isn't cool

9
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:36,031
Yeah. Finding a common
goal is very difficult

10
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,664
I don't know if I'll
be able to do it

11
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:40,499
Relax, we just need to rest

12
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:41,840
Rest?

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,735
That I know how to do.
I'm the Hakuru of resting.

14
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:56,284
I also envied my brother
for thousands of years

15
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,135
I know you'd like to be with them

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,540
Be their Hakuru

17
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:06,893
But if you really care about
them, it's best to stay away.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,926
I'm here!

19
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:21,770
Whose suitcase is this? Mom's?

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
They're mine.

21
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm leaving

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,349
The company is doing very badly in the East

23
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,746
I have to go and take care of it personally

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,775
What?

25
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,793
How long will you be gone?

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,272
I don't know

27
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:41,159
But I'll deposit money for
you. You won't miss anything.

28
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,606
I don't care about the damn money

29
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,399
You can't buy me like one of your lackeys!

30
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:51,882
I won't allow you to speak to me like that.

31
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:57,239
You're abandoning me like
mom did! You're worse than her!

32
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,050
Lon!

33
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,414
Are you okay? If you need to
talk, you know you can trust me

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,582
Yeah, I'm fine

35
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:43,658
In the next Sendokai match,
The Human Team will face Lesay

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,125
Lesay?

37
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,499
He really exists!

38
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,267
Who is he?

39
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:53,465
A wizard

40
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,450
In Masara, the mothers tell their children

41
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,235
that if they don't behave well,

42
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,789
Lesay will come and give them nightmares

43
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,716
That guy gives me the chills

44
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,044
Let the Sendokai begin!

45
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,859
I got it!

46
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,125
The Humans take the do!

47
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,283
They're approaching the Senrok! And....

48
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,558
Kai!

49
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,556
Lesay hasn't even lifted a finger!

50
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,603
I think that under that mask he's asleep

51
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:58,396
Lesay and just released some kind of fog.

52
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:05,467
What is this I don't feel well...

53
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:33,479
What's going on?

54
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:50,640
That fog is using their
fears to cause hallucinations.

55
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,312
The Humans are behaving strangely

56
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Cloe!

57
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:06,968
Cloe!

58
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,945
Zak!

59
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,650
Cloe!

60
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,321
Cloe!

61
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:11,675
Lon!

62
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:20,663
Come with me

63
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,704
Damn Selfish!

64
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,408
Who do you think pays for this house?

65
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:28,717
Dad?

66
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,966
I wish we never met!

67
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,919
I've thrown my life away!

68
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:34,755
I hate you!

69
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,637
Mom!

70
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,268
No! Please don't fight again!

71
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Not again!

72
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,190
Kai for Lesay!

73
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,489
Come on guys, react!

74
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:01,341
Those visions aren't real.

75
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,205
It's your mind deceiving you.

76
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,971
Oh, not by all the gods of the Sen!

77
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,635
What's wrong?

78
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,299
I just remembered where I know
her from. That woman is Chronam-Yatt!

79
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,894
Come with me.

80
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,943
Cloe, you have to choose one of us

81
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,506
Of course!

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,787
If the mind deceives you, then...

83
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:49,451
Guys! Don't believe what
you see, follow your heart!

84
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:59,490
If the heart chooses the destination,
believe me, there will be no better journey

85
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,787
A Human has managed to break free!

86
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:25,343
Ignore the visions! Let
your heart guide you!

87
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:28,630
Let your heart guide you!

88
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,381
And what about me?

89
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:47,965
<i>Unintelligible Arguing</i>

90
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,175
Look what you did!

91
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,047
Your mother is leaving

92
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,428
And it's your fault!

93
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:54,415
No!

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,668
It wasn't my fault!

95
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,321
We don't want you

96
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,987
No one loves you!

97
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,862
You're alone.

98
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:12,045
Kai for Lesay!

99
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,329
One more and the victory will be his!

100
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:18,738
Oh no!

101
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:22,178
We need to protect the Senrok!

102
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Lon!

103
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,498
We need you!

104
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,140
I'm alone

105
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,704
I'm alone

106
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Lon

107
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:35,163
You're not alone

108
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,634
Lon

109
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,222
You're not alone

110
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,775
You're not alone!

111
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,881
I'm here with you

112
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,733
Cloe

113
00:09:55,758 --> 00:10:00,589
You just won a fight. But
we still have another one.

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,404
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

115
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,839
The Humans react!

116
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,982
They're approaching the Senrok!

117
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,407
Kai for the Humans!

118
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:48,519
They won the Sendokai!

119
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Yeah!

120
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,619
Cloe

121
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:14,353
I wanted to thank you
for what you did today.

122
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:16,357
It was very important to me.

123
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:19,149
Ah, no need

124
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:20,268
Congratulations!

125
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,821
You really are the best
Hakuro they can have

126
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:31,935
Thank you. With this
team. Nothing can go wrong.

127
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,489
I wouldn't be so sure....

128
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:41,179
The woman accompanying
Sidmodius is not a simple Chron.

129
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:47,143
She and her sister were
created by the gods of Sen

130
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:52,469
To maintain the balance of
good and evil in the Multi-Verse

131
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:56,700
Chronam-Yatt is a goddess of evil.

132
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,175
That is absurd!

133
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,220
Absurd... But true

134
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:10,335
By defeating the Zorn empire you
tilted the balance and good triumphed.

135
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,615
Now, my sister wants to
return the multiverse to darkness

136
00:12:15,475 --> 00:12:18,522
And Sidmodius is her puppet

137
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:21,542
She may have Sidmodius,

138
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:26,755
But we have.... each other!

139
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,784
Yeah!

140
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,776
Well said!
