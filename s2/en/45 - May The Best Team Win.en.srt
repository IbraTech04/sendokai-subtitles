1
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,207
It would be better if we didn't talk until this is all over

2
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,919
Ugh. But- But what's it about

3
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,996
Although he has a point

4
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:56,058
The tournament comes first

5
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,277
No!

6
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:01,421
It's more important to act like someone with feelings!

7
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,919
What if it's an excuse?

8
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,069
What if he doesn't like me anymore?

9
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:08,797
Ugh, what a mess

10
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:11,450
This can't possibly get more complicated

11
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,625
Lon! What's up?

12
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,679
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

13
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:22,292
I wanted to talk to you,

14
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:25,187
Talk... About what?

15
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:29,350
You see, the other day in the fight I realized something

16
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,579
I-

17
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:37,088
I like you it's Chloe.  I like you a lot.

18
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:42,411
And, well. I was wondering if you feel the same

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Lon-

20
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,288
Hey, don't worry.

21
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,364
It's no big deal

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,557
But it's still important to me

23
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,679
We're friends, right?

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Yeah

25
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,843
If not, who's going to give you records?

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
That's true

27
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:07,494
If Fenzy loans me her heavy metal albums,
my head might explode

28
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,840
It's because of Zack, right?

29
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,198
You like him

30
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,445
What? No no no it's not that!

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,181
In the next battle,

32
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:45,615
the Baron Ragnaki and the fire masters will face each other!

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,910
There is no Baron Ragnaki.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,570
You can't deceive, we know the truth

35
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,269
The truth?

36
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:58,562
The truth is whatever the inhabitants of Masara believe

37
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:00,815
And Masara believes me.

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,750
Masara-Sendo-Kayetsu

39
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,620
Let the Sendokai begin!

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
What a move!

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,355
The Masters of Fire are heading to the Senrock!

42
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,626
Kai!

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,066
Yeah!!

44
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,960
Yeah!

45
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,120
The Baron Ragnaki reacts!

46
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,220
Running with the do

47
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:24,606
But he loses it!

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,685
The rivals are clearly superior!

49
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,660
The audience can't help you win

50
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,700
They wont, but the energy I stole will

51
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,107
What's this?

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,966
Oh no!

53
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,864
He's going to use all the energy he has in Sestrad's chest!

54
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,224
The Baron has transformed!

55
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:41,058
Now he's stronger and- Wow!

56
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,628
He certainly has some fine abs

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,546
Incredible!

58
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,775
Kai to the Baron Ragnaki!

59
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:21,873
Conceited.

60
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,405
You're nothing more than stones, and you fight as such

61
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,351
Second Kai to the Baron Ragnaki!

62
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,116
One more and he takes this victory!

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,677
You asked for it. You leave us no other choice

64
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,035
The masters of fire are about to unleash some kind of....

65
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,988
Force!

66
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,510
Nero-Sen-

67
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,904
There it is....

68
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Fusion!

69
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,210
It looks like the Fire Masters are going to win the

70
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,021
fight with this Kai!

71
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,862
The Baron saves this situation at the last possible moment

72
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,820
now come back

73
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,490
of course where are you going in such a hurry

74
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,570
no god is too strong let's go we have to

75
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,850
use the function again yes

76
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,330
I want to talk to tag that won't be

77
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,260
possible  I understand what you feel but

78
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,510
you can't let emotions

79
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,040
interfere with your mission if it

80
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,630
really matters' fac it's better if we don't

81
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,140
see each other until this is all over

82
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,130
in which case could you give her this from me I'm

83
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,600
sorry Chloe this is not the time for this

84
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,679
[  Music]

85
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,570
that I knew

86
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,140
and they knew

87
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,320
[Music]

88
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,210
hidden with us but it would happen to us they will

89
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,720
end up unmasking us it can

90
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,160
happen to you these are the most powerful beings

91
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,720
of clarity the eyes play with their fragile

92
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,020
in their stories that they have done to

93
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:33,490
stop the Yaquis exactly no  just

94
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,340
need someone took well came back

95
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,740
yesterday to god I offer to me he died

96
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,840
[Music]

97
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,950
and again this map has been broken it has

98
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,920
not been broken I am reacting like the

99
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,740
public and this is more than just a simple

100
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,920
kill

101
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,750
or not if not god has won  In that case

102
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,540
you better learn to use

103
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,720
nero sen fusion because you are the last

104
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,990
hope the multiverse calm down if

105
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,089
we don't make it I'm sure I

106
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,300
think the guys will do it as a

107
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,740
team that one more now I don't know

108
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,480
hey guys  Before the

109
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,380
fight begins, I wanted to wish you luck, of course, that

110
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,200
the best team wins. If the kibbutz

111
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,380
lose, release the fusion and give them a

112
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,250
choice, as well as God, on our side,

113
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,499
friends, friends, friends,

114
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:00,609
rivals, and I confess that I'm going to

115
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:05,339
feel a little sad kicking the ball.  rear

116
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:09,939
a question fifth has given something on

117
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,539
my part human type and reason do not go

118
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:15,329
to the field I

119
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,199
do not know

120
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,260
where they are
