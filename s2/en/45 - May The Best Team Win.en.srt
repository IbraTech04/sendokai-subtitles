1
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,207
It would be better if we
didn't talk until this is all over

2
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,919
Ugh. But- But what's it about

3
00:00:51,944 --> 00:00:53,996
Although he has a point

4
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:56,058
The tournament comes first

5
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,277
No!

6
00:00:57,506 --> 00:01:01,421
It's more important to act
like someone with feelings!

7
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,919
What if it's an excuse?

8
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,069
What if he doesn't like me anymore?

9
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:08,797
Ugh, what a mess

10
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:11,450
This can't possibly get more complicated

11
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:17,625
Lon! What's up?

12
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,679
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

13
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:22,292
I wanted to talk to you,

14
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:25,187
Talk... About what?

15
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:29,350
You see, the other day in
the fight I realized something

16
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,579
I-

17
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:37,017
I like you it's Cloe.  I like you a lot.

18
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:42,411
And, well. I was wondering
if you feel the same

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Lon-

20
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,288
Hey, don't worry.

21
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,364
It's no big deal

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,470
But it's still important to me

23
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,627
We're friends, right?

24
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:58,619
Yeah

25
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,843
If not, who's going to give you records?

26
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:02,560
That's true

27
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:07,494
If Fenzy loans me her heavy metal albums,
my head might explode

28
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,070
It's because of Zak, right?

29
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:16,198
You like him

30
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,510
What? No no no it's not that!

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,181
In the next battle,

32
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:45,873
the Barón Raknaki and the
Masters of Fire will face each other!

33
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,910
There is no Barón Raknaki.

34
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,484
You can't deceive us, we know the truth

35
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,269
The truth?

36
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:58,562
The truth is whatever the
inhabitants of Masara believe

37
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:00,815
And Masara believes me.

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,750
Masara-Sendo-Kayetsu

39
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,620
Let the Sendokai begin!

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
What a move!

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,355
The Masters of Fire are
heading to the Senrok!

42
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,626
Kai!

43
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,066
Yeah!

44
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,960
Yeah!

45
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,120
The Barón Raknaki reacts!

46
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,220
Running with the do

47
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:24,606
But he loses it!

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,685
The rivals are clearly superior!

49
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,660
The audience can't help you win

50
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:44,700
They wont, but the energy I stole will

51
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,107
What's this?

52
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,966
Oh no!

53
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:59,864
He's going to use all the
energy he has in Sestrad's chest!

54
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:38,175
The Barón has transformed!

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,058
Now he's stronger and- Wow!

56
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,628
He certainly has some fine abs

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,546
Incredible!

58
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,775
Kai to the Barón Raknaki!

59
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:21,786
Conceited.

60
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,405
You're nothing more than
stones, and you fight as such

61
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,351
Second Kai to the Barón Raknaki!

62
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,116
One more and he takes this victory!

63
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,677
You asked for it. You
leave us no other choice

64
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,035
The Masters of Fire are about
to unleash some kind of....

65
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,988
Force!

66
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,510
Nero-Sen-

67
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,904
There it is....

68
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Fusion!

69
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,210
It looks like the Fire
Masters are going to win the

70
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,021
fight with this Kai!

71
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,862
The Barón saves this situation
at the last possible moment

72
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,937
I'll be right back

73
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,034
Cloe?

74
00:08:10,696 --> 00:08:12,843
Where are you going in such a hurry?

75
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,130
The Barón is not giving up!

76
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,073
Sidmodius is very strong!

77
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:28,545
Magmus! We have to use the fusion again!

78
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,570
Yes.

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,950
Nero-Sen....

80
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,047
Kai to the Barón!

81
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,805
He's won the fight!

82
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:11,779
I want to talk to Zak.

83
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:16,982
That won't be possible.
I understand what you feel

84
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:20,666
But you can't let emotions interfere
with your mission

85
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:23,929
If you really care
about Zak, it's better if-

86
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:24,709
Yeah, yeah

87
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:29,175
We shouldn't see each other
until this is all over

88
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:34,301
In that case, could you
give him this for me?

89
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,776
I'm sorry Cloe
This is not the time for this

90
00:09:56,822 --> 00:09:57,891
I knew it...

91
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,140
I knew it!

92
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:10,781
You may have defeated us, but the
Masarianos will end up unmasking you

93
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,002
You think so?

94
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:16,337
People of Masara!

95
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:20,481
Are these the most powerful
beings on the planet?

96
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:25,956
The Fire Masters,
with their magic and their stories

97
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:28,932
What did they do to stop the Yakis?

98
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:29,957
Nothing!

99
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,025
Exactly!

100
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:38,292
Masara needs someone
to rule with an iron fist!

101
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,949
And I offer to you: my fist!

102
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,392
What? Again?!

103
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
This map is broken

104
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,038
It's not broken

105
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,527
It's reacting to the audience!

106
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:00,157
I think this is more than just a map

107
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:02,049
Oh no!

108
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,042
Sidmodius has won!

109
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:09,283
In that case, you better learn to use
the Nero-Sen fusion

110
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,275
Because you are the last hope
for the multiverse

111
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Don't worry

112
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:18,275
If we can't do it, I'm sure Cloe and
the boys will

113
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:22,969
Team Kiwun, Masara is waiting for us!

114
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,925
Hey, guys!

115
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:42,362
Before the next fight begins
I wanted to wish you luck

116
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:45,314
Of course! May the best team win!

117
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,269
If we Kiwuns lose

118
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:51,348
Activate the fusion and teach
Sidmodius a lesson for us

119
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,063
Sure

120
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:56,823
We are friends! Friends and rivals

121
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,675
Friends and rivals.

122
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,345
Guys! I confess it's going to make
me a little sad to beat your asses

123
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:07,932
Zak, quick question.

124
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:10,571
Has Kento given you anything from me?

125
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,191
Human team, Kiwun team, to the field!

126
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,199
That's us!

127
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:22,349
Where's Lon?

128
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,944
And now the Human Team
will face the Kiwun Team!
