Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you

13
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:22,292
I wanted to talk to you,

14
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:25,187
Talk... About what?

15
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:29,350
You see, the other day in the fight I realized something

16
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,579
I-

17
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:37,088
I like you it's Chloe.  I like you a lot.

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Lon-

20
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,288
Hey, don't worry.

It's no big deal

23
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,679
We're friends, right?

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720

That's true

27
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:07,494
If Fenzy loans me her heavy metal albums, 
my head might explode

28
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,840
It's because of Zack, right?

29
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:16,198
You like him

30

The truth is whatever the inhabitants of Masara believe
