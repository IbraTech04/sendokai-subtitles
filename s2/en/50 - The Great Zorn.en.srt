1
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,100
I hate you all!

2
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,920
I hate you all!

3
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,925
Someday I will be strong,
and this won't happen again

4
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,511
I will create a more just world.

5
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:56,234
A world without pain!

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,440
The Zorn Fortress!

7
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,050
This is where Zack the traitor
and the others defeated the Zorns!

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
At last!

9
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:55,920
Strike!

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,437
Remind me not to come
with you on the next invasion

11
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:29,660
I will do that, if there <i>is</i> a "next time"

12
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:39,445
Baron Ragnaki's team
has scored their first Kai!

13
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,345
And take possession

14
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,160
He's playing dirty!

15
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,619
Is THIS the leader you want for Masara?

16
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,067
Sidmodius has all of Danima's powers!

17
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,840
We can't stop him!

18
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:03,850
He may have Danima's powers

19
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,093
But we have something more important!

20
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Her teachings!

21
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah!

22
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:20,803
Go-Sen Tornado!

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,963
The humans have reacted!

24
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:31,363
Wow! Their rapport is impressive!

25
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,770
Zet-Sen Shot!

26
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,456
Kai for the Humans!

27
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,190
No!

28
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Yes!

29
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:25,865
See? Clean fighting!
That's how real heros fight!

30
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:35,490
Humans! Humans! Humans!

31
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:39,705
Damn traitors. The Baron is
the man you should worship

32
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:49,396
Huh? The map is feeling
the energy of the public again!

33
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,810
But this time it looks.... different

34
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:54,124
He's reacting

35
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,264
When Zack finally discovers
the true power of the map

36
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,323
Nothing will stop them.

37
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,729
But only a true Hakuru
can [something] the map

38
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,023
And Zack isn't ready yet

39
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,668
Not until you face your own limits.

40
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:15,920
Also, there's something
about this fight that I'm not liking

41
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,310
You asked for it....

42
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,050
Oh no....

43
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:32,695
A nero rock!

44
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,664
He must've stolen it from
me when he fought us

45
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,990
Nero... at... Sen!

46
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,023
Huh?!

47
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,419
The Baron has transformed again!

48
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,954
Quiet! Do not move!

49
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,400
Relax, Lon

50
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm not here to hurt you

51
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,227
Do you know who that helmet belonged to?

52
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,323
It belonged to the
founder of the Zorn Empire

53
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,723
He was a warrior with a vision

54
00:06:55,748 --> 00:07:00,349
He didn't stop until he
got everything he wanted

55
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,376
And he wanted the
same thing as you, Lon

56
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Me?

57
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:14,196
Wouldn't you like to be
stronger and create a new world?

58
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:19,654
A more just world.
A world without pain.

59
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,235
Whoever wears that
helmet will rule the Multiverse

60
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,825
And will put an end to all
those who made him suffer

61
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:35,913
Whoever wears that helmet
will become The Great Zorn

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,624
Oh no! They're going to
activate the Nero-Sen Fusion!

63
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,943
Kiet! Fenzy!

64
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,168
You have to use
the Duo-Sen Wall!

65
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,579
The wall wont resist the fusion!

66
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,334
I know. But it will
absorb the impact!

67
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,277
Chloe, you're with me!

68
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,315
Duo-Sen Wall!

69
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,289
Nero-Sen Fusion!

70
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,536
Now!

71
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,576
Kai for the Baron Ragnaki!

72
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,463
One more and he will
win the Grand Tournament!

73
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:47,269
Oh no. If Sidmodius uses the Fusion
on them again, he'll destroy them

74
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,599
It's over. This is the end

75
00:09:59,624 --> 00:10:03,370
It can't be! What
are we going to do?!

76
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,357
We're going to activate
the Nero-Sen fusion!

77
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:01,632
But we don't know what
feeling we have in common

78
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,755
Since we met, we've been
through so much together

79
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,370
We've been beaten,
ridiculed, shot,

80
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:26,539
We've suffered

81
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
On Earth

82
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,333
And in the depths
of the Multiverse

83
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,893
But we kept moving forward

84
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:55,186
Maybe one day we won't
be able to save ourselves

85
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,098
But today is not that day.

86
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:07,570
Because even if we lose
everything, we still have our friendship

87
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,400
And that's what matters

88
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:16,189
Because that's the
feeling that unites us

89
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,903
Nero-Sen Fusion!

90
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,183
Nero-Sen Fusion!

91
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,011
Come on, guys!
