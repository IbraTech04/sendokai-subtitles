1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
How did it go?

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sidmodius escaped

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,720
We have to find another way
to save you.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Forget about me.

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,720
The mission comes first.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,320
I don't care about the mission.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,493
I'm not going to let you die.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,400
There must be something we can do.

9
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:06,040
Maybe there's one last option

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,390
You must go to the Nero-Rock Volcano

11
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,855
And find the Fire Lords.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
The Fire Lords?

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,788
They are the most powerful beings in
Masara and they guard the Nero Rocks.

14
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:30,352
Rocks with the power to save lives

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,868
Quick, guys.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,920
Priestess.

17
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,320
I told them what they needed to know.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,296
Damn Sidmodius!

20
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,455
Always wanted to be the Great Sun.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,480
And he'll do anything to get it.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Not if we stop him.

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
There's something I don't understand.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Why is Chronam-Yatt helping him?

25
00:02:04,977 --> 00:02:06,000
What does she want?

26
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:13,015
Even I don't know why
she's helping Sidmodius

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,320
Chronam-Sunn!

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,415
My sister obeys
forces beyond your understanding.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,400
Evil forces.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,135
We have to go to Masara
and warn the Sen-Kuns!

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,030
Only they can stop Sidmodius!

32
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:34,024
"Masara" is Earth in the past. How
are we going to travel through time?

33
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,160
I'll take you there.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,970
The Nero Rock volcano.

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,180
We're in a world with spaceships
and no one invents an elevator.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,920
This is no time for laughing!

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,305
We have to get back to
Danima as soon as possible!

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,727
Danima wouldn't be in danger if you
hadn't let Sidmodius get away!

39
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,305
You could have stopped him too.

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,423
If you keep fighting like little children,
we won't be able to save Danima!

41
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
Calm down, Zak Everything
will be fine. You'll see.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,032
I hope so.

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,673
Hey, Chloe.

44
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:43,805
I was thinking...

45
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,255
Yes?

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,120
I know I messed up last time,
but.

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you want to go to
the movies on Saturday?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wow, I'd love to.

49
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:59,895
But I already made plans with
Lon to go to a concert that day.

50
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,141
A band we really like is playing.

51
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,920
Ah. Great.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,672
Zak...

53
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,735
Hey guys!

54
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,024
Look!

55
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:29,120
Wow, what crappy statues.

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,524
Looks like the sculptor was in a hurry.

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,175
My name is Magmus The Fire Lord

58
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,868
And that's Obsedia

59
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:40,895
Sorry

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
I meant the little ones.

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,615
They're Lethos and Tectos

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,760
Okay, forget me.

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,280
What brings you here?

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,009
We're looking for a Nero Rock.

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,415
Owning a rock
is a big responsibility.

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,160
We'll only give it to you if
you beat us in a Sendokai!

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Okay.

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,618
Let's fight!

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,015
Guys we have to give
it our all from the start!

70
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,282
It's all up to us.

71
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,329
Let the Sendokai begin!

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,454
Nu-Sen Flare!

73
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,360
Cloe!

74
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,845
Cloe!

75
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,860
Zet-Sen Shot!

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,954
No.

77
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,243
Sho-Sen Fire!

78
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,259
Duo-Sen Force!

79
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,063
They're unbeatable.

80
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Zak

81
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,240
We need to use the Duo-Sen Force!

82
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
That's impossible.

83
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,360
Lon and I don't get along.

84
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:13,440
And that's why you're
going to let Danima die?

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,149
Out of pride?

86
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
You're right

87
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,080
Lon

88
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,280
We have to do it.

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,938
For Danima

90
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,352
Duo-Sen....

91
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,001
...Sen!

92
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:54,384
Nero-Sen Fusion!

93
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,290
We have to stop that.

94
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,126
Duo-Sen Wall!

95
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:23,555
No!

96
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,215
A Nero Rock

97
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,882
It's yours.

98
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,600
But we lost.

99
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,495
You put aside your
pride to do the right thing.

100
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,438
You deserve it.

101
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,915
Thank you very much.

102
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:20,280
Danima!

103
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,520
We got the rock!

104
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,993
I knew you would get it!

105
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:32,782
Nero-At-Sen

106
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,798
Put up your bracelets.

107
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Is that's what I think it is?

108
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,118
Sen-Do-Kai!

109
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,015
These are Nero Armors

110
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,175
Your powers will increase by one level

111
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,938
and you will be able to unleash a new power

112
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,560
Which power is it?

113
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,295
When you are all completely attuned,
you can perform the Nero-Sen Fusion.

114
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,240
That's what the Fire Lords used!

115
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,520
Danima, I don't understand!

116
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,335
How are these suits of armor
going to save your life?

117
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Thanks to it, you will defeat
Sidmodius and save many lives.

118
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,520
But not mine.

119
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,563
What?

120
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,664
Relax

121
00:10:49,688 --> 00:10:53,555
My Sen will return to Masara

122
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,890
In some way, I will
always be with you.

123
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,120
Zak

124
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,615
Carrying this map
is a big responsibility.

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,535
It means you'll do
what's best for your team.

126
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,415
Even if it's not what's best for you.

127
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,175
That's your real mission.

128
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,815
Because that's what a Hakuru does.

129
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,155
But I don't know how to do that.

130
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,640
No one does.

131
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,820
Until he learns.

132
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,030
Danima!

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,171
Masara has lost its priestess.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,160
Uncertain times are ahead.
