1
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
How did it go?

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes. God escaped.

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,720
We have to find another way
to save you.

4
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Forget about me.

5
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,720
The mission comes first.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,320
I don't care. The mission.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm not going to let you die.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,400
There must be something we can do.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,160
A maybe.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,720
What?

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,720
One last option.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,680
You must go to the Rock Volcano.

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,720
Number and find the Fire Lords.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
The Fire Lords.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720
They are the most powerful beings in Masada
and they guard the rocks.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,080
Nero has stones with the power

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
to save lives.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Quick, guys.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,920
Priestess.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Why didn't you tell them the truth?

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,320
I told them what they needed to know.

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,640
Damn you.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,200
God has always wanted to be the Great Sun.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,480
And he'll do anything to get it.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Not if we stop him.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,680
There's something I don't understand.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Why is Conan Wyatt helping him?

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
But what does he want?

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Even I don't know why you're helping.

30
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,320
The Krogan are.

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,080
My sister obeys
forces beyond your understanding.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,400
Evil forces.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,680
We have to go and warn the boys.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Only they can pay you.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,520
And even more so now. This is Earth in the past.

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
How are we going to travel through time?

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,160
I'll take you there.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,080
The Black Rock volcano.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,240
We're in a world with spaceships

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
and no one invents an elevator.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
No one.

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,920
This is no time for laughing.

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,800
We have to get back to Ánima
as soon as possible.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,480
He wouldn't be in danger if you hadn't
let him get away for no reason.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,120
You could have stopped him too.

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Yes. Stop fighting
like little children.

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
We won't be able to save Anima.

48
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,120
Calm down.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
Everything will be fine.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
You'll see.

51
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I hope so.

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Hey, Chloe.

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,280
I was thinking,

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,120
I know I messed up last time,
but.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you want to go to the movies on Saturday?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wow, I'd love to.

57
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,800
But I already made plans with Leon
to go to a concert that day.

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
A band we really like is playing.

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
Ah. Great.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Zack and me. Guys,

61
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,760
mirad.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
Fijaos.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,120
What crappy statues.

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Looks like the sculptor was in a hurry.

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
My name is Mar.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
I save people from fires.

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,840
And it's obsidian.

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,920
Sorry.

69
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,560
I meant the little ones.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
They're cute

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,640
and entitled.

72
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,760
Okay, forget me.

73
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,280
What brings you here?

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,600
We're looking for a rock.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
But.

76
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Owning a rock
is a big responsibility.

77
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,160
We'll only give it to you
if the sparrows still touch each other.

78
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
Okay.

79
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Luchemos.

80
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Chicos,

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
we have to give it our all
from the start.

82
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,200
It's all up to us.

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Who's got sense?

84
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,880
Flash.

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,880
No sé.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Cloe.

87
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Cloe.

88
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Disparó de.

89
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,000
A. Partnership.

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,640
Hacia.

91
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,960
El amor.

92
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,160
They're unbeatable.

93
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Zack,

94
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,840
We need strength.

95
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
Two on.

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
That's impossible.

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,440
Lon and I aren't in sync.

98
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
And that's why you're going to let Danny die

99
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,880
out of pride?

100
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
He's right,

101
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,080
Blon.

102
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,280
We have to do it.

103
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
for Danny. Yes.

104
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Not force.

105
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes. Solve them.

106
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,640
We have to stop that.

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Ahora.

108
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:23,040
Ya. No.

109
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,680
It's the rock.

110
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,800
It's ours.

111
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,600
But we lost.

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
You put aside
your pride to do the right thing.

113
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
You deserve it.

114
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Thank you very much.

115
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,280
You're welcome.

116
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,520
We got the rock.

117
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I knew you wouldn't get it.

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
The number.

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,320
I mean, in.

120
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
About the bracelets.

121
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
That's what I think it is.

122
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Find it.

123
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Son armaduras.

124
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,040
Número.

125
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,680
Your powers will increase by one level

126
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
and you will be able to unleash a new one.

127
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,560
Powers.

128
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,040
When you are all
completely attuned,

129
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,320
you can perform the fusion. But

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,240
that's
what the Fire Lords have done.

131
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,520
I don't understand. Are you up for it?

132
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,920
How are these suits of armor
going to save your life?

133
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,200
Thanks to it, you will be like God

134
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
and save many lives.

135
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,520
But not mine.

136
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,520
What? Relax.

137
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,200
They say they'll come back together with masks.

138
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,520
Somehow,
I'll always be with you.

139
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,120
Others. Zack.

140
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,960
Carrying this map
is a big responsibility.

141
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,480
It means you'll do
what's best for your team.

142
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,280
Even if it's not what's best for you.

143
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,600
That's your real mission.

144
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Because that's what a future does.

145
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,000
But I don't know how to do that.

146
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,640
No one does.

147
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,760
Until he learns.

148
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,120
What?

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
More. He has lost his priestess.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,160
Uncertain times are ahead.
