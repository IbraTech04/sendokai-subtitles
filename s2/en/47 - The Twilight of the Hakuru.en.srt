1
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:33,705
We Have to activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

2
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:36,075
But We Haven't Found a Common Goal

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,740
We Have to Hate Zack

4
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,798
We'll Never Hate Zack

5
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:43,709
Because He's Our Friend

6
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:54,043
Come With Me And We'll Return The
Multiverse to the Abysses of Darkness

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,518
I'm not going to let you get away with this

8
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,092
Sister...

9
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,120
Chloe, You Are the Worst

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,660
The Human Warrior Heads Alone
towards the Senrok of His Rivals!

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,283
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

12
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,169
Go-sen Tornado!

13
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,570
Kinan!, Kiwey!

14
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,240
My boys!

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,070
Nu-Sen Flare!

16
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,700
Kai from the Human Team!

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,981
Brothers! Are you okay?

18
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,420
I feel like a Norkingo sat on me

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,340
Kido, you'll have to fight for us.

20
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,360
What?  But I...

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,720
Oh No!!, Why did Kido's Slob
have to stay? We are doomed!

22
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,420
We are not doomed! And I am not a jerk!!

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,340
I am Kido The Destroyer!!!

24
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,940
Caramba!! The Short Kiwun Has
out-played the Human Warrior!!

25
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,480
What do we have here, huh?

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Tai-Sen Trail!

27
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,390
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

28
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,635
Kido!!

29
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,040
Wow!! There are only 2
warriors left on the field!!

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,580
No, Lon! Why?

31
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:19,340
This has gone too far.

32
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:33,360
Evil will once again rule the multiverse
Sister, it's too late to stop it from going

33
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,980
Come along, Yakis! The time has come.

34
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,360
Where are you taking them?

35
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,297
No, stop!

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,980
You stop me, if you can

37
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,403
Your effort is useless.

38
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:44,220
Join me, sister, and we will see
together how the Multiverse burns!

39
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:49,940
I am not one of your Puppets!
I am the Goddess of Good!

40
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,220
And the Duty of a goddess
of Good is to fight Evil!!

41
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,987
The Combat is Very Even!

42
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,105
Zet-Sen shot!

43
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,930
Zet-Sen Shot!

44
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,023
You couldn't stand that
I was the Hakuru, right?

45
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:12,192
That's why you stole
the only thing I had left.

46
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,340
What the heck are you talking about?

47
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,980
Chloe!

48
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,340
You feel that?

49
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,940
Feel what?

50
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,460
Loneliness

51
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,956
Everyone Has Fallen. And
Now you're the only one left

52
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:52,330
That's What My Life Consists
Of, and now yours too!

53
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
No, Lon! Please!

54
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,900
Zack!

55
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,683
Sho-Sen Fire!

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,420
No!

57
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,460
Kido!

58
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,840
My boy!

59
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,565
By Brott's Gums!!

60
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,150
One of the Kiwuns has sacrificed
himself to protect his teammate!!

61
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,740
Kido!

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,360
Kiwey

63
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,760
Kinan

64
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,935
Fools!!

65
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,337
You help each other, but you are alone!

66
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,560
You are alone!

67
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,760
No Lon, You don't understand

68
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,949
Precisely in the darkest hours

69
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,726
It's when you feel the most that
there is someone by your side.

70
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:34,863
Listen to this and don't forget: A Sendokai
Warrior is never alone if he has a team

71
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,180
That's impossible! How-

72
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,673
Nero-Sen Fusion!

73
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:56,500
Incredible! When it seemed
impossible, Team Kiwun has won the fight!!

74
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,320
Zack!

75
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,858
Kido!

76
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,244
Zack, are you okay?

77
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm alright, don't worry about me.
the Kiwuns have taken the worst part.

78
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,351
Kido...

79
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:19,360
I think there won't
be any Lenguaconga today

80
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,920
Kido... I... I want to
tell you something... I

81
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,440
haven't always been fair to you,
sometimes I... I don't know how to say

82
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,020
I'm sorry...?

83
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,540
Alright, alright. I forgive you!

84
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,560
No Dad, that's what
you're trying to say!

85
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,661
Ah! Yes it's true! That's it

86
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,360
Kido, you've behaved like a true Warrior!

87
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,919
Poor Naives! Your Joy will not last long!

88
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:09,688
The Humans are eliminated and
these Kiwuns will take months to recover.

89
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:15,938
There is only one warrior left
to face me! Good Luck, Zack...

90
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,660
He May Have Become Very
Strong. But He's Still a Vermin!

91
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:32,500
Still, you're right. The Kiwuns
can't fight, we only have Zack left

92
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:40,238
...Unless we abide by Kronyan's
Law and you join Team Kiwun!

93
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,288
That is, if you accept
me back into the team...

94
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:45,640
That's it, It's done dude!

95
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,860
Well of course we accept you!

96
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,600
You've always been Our Hakuru, Zack

97
00:11:56,384 --> 00:12:03,320
The team fights together again...
Together, we will defeat Sidmodius!!!

98
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:07,003
Yes!

99
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,580
Surrender! I do not want to hurt you!

100
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,980
That's why you and I are so different!!

101
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
And That's Why I Win!

102
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,780
You see?  In the end You joined Me

103
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,700
We can't leave Lon Here

104
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,180
Are you serious?!  After what he's done?!

105
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,080
He Needs help. Where is he?

106
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,540
I hate you all!

107
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,820
I hate you all!
