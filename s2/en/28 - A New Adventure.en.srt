1
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,350
Okay Zach

2
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,396
This is it

3
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,378
Today's the day you ask Chloe out

4
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,725
To the movies

5
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,683
do-do-do-do-do

6
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,936
Can't you play with a ball
of wool like a normal cat

7
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:27,790
Zach! Downstairs!

8
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,119
Hurry up

9
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,485
You don't want to be late
for the first day of school

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
Coming! Coming!

11
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,582
There are eggs in the fridge

12
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:38,380
Your little sister has
a doctor's appointment

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,262
Oh-

14
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,890
Since Ona was born,

15
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:42,847
It's like I don't even exist

16
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:44,640
That's just not true, uh

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,527
What was your name? Zek?

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,746
Zat?

19
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,087
Ha-ha. Hilarious

20
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:54,840
Being her big brother is as
much a responsibility as being an

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,530
interdimensional warrior

22
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,038
I saved planet Earth, you know?

23
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:02,252
And now?

24
00:02:02,277 --> 00:02:03,680
I change diapers

25
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,033
Hey, Chloe!

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,559
Hey Zack! How's it going?

27
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:17,055
Excited about your
first day back at school?

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,274
Uh, sure.

29
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,265
Although I'll be even more

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,907
excited when it's over

31
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
Actually, you know

32
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,125
I wanted to talk to you about that

33
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:31,001
I was thinking- Um

34
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,855
Are you doing anything after school?

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,795
Because, if you want, um

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,940
We could catch a movie together

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,245
Excellent! I thought you are never gonna ask!

38
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,287
Well...

39
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:46,485
I just found two tickets lying

40
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,323
on the street

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,076
Yeah, right.

42
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:50,147
Sure you did

43
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,178
Hey! What's up, guys?

44
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:05,832
What a drag! Back to school

45
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,945
Remember when we used to go on missions?

46
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,895
And save people and stuff?

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
Now that was cool

48
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:14,114
Well, other things are fun too

49
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:15,615
I don't know. Like...

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,894
...going to the movies

51
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,420
Yeah, I guess our next mission is to become

52
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,577
responsible students

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,974
Zach! Dude! You're the best!

54
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,356
Yeah! As well as being an awesome warrior,

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,748
You're super fun-

56
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,492
Shut it, dummy!

57
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,550
We can't talk about...
you know... the warriors

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Oh

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,204
Class! Let's have some quiet in here

60
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,852
I'd like to introduce a new classmate!

61
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,669
His name is Lon

62
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:10,739
His family just moved to
the area so I hope you'll

63
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,239
all be nice to him

64
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,610
you can sit there, Lon

65
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,100
Okay, everyone! This semester we're going

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,180
to be studying- psst! Hey,
dude! I'm Zach! Nice to

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,846
meet you

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,839
Hey!

69
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,181
My name's Zack!

70
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,740
I tried to say hi earlier but
I guess you didn't hear me

71
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,910
we're going to play a little game of

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,919
soccer and I thought you might want to

73
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:47,854
join in

74
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,446
I'm not interested in your

75
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,310
little games, and I heard you fine I just

76
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,183
didn't feel like saying hi

77
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,060
Hey! If you can't play, no
problem. But there's no

78
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,110
need to be rude

79
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:05,441
I can play. I'd kick your butt!

80
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:08,381
Yeah? I'd like to see you try.

81
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,624
Say the word.

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,033
Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep-Beep

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,573
Whoa! My wannabe tough guy

84
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,730
detector is about to explode!

85
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,620
Zach, weren't you going to the movies

86
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,797
with Chloe?

87
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,102
You'll be late!

88
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,899
This will only take a second

89
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:44,495
Ready?

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Steady!

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Go!

92
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:26,286
What was that?

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,028
What in the heck?

94
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,850
Where'd he pop up from?

95
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,076
We gotta stop it!

96
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:49,795
But how? We're not Sendokai

97
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,399
warriors anymore

98
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:56,291
No

99
00:07:03,588 --> 00:07:04,769
Good idea!

100
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,608
I can't leave you on your own for a second

101
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,634
Tanpo!

102
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:54,180
This town is weird

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,480
What in the world was that?

104
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:01,899
A Yaki. A spirit without sen

105
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,175
We bring bad news

106
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,731
Minister Sidmodius-

107
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,650
-Disappeared when the Zorn Fortress

108
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,179
exploded, right?

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
No.

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,136
Before the fortress exploded

111
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,830
Sidmodius and Cronam-Yatt

112
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,774
took Sestrad's Chest

113
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,526
And fled to another dimension

114
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:30,870
Sidmodius is using the chest to

115
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,580
drain the sen energy from the

116
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,313
inhabitants making himself stronger.

117
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:40,032
Each time Sidmodius absorbs a creature's energy,

118
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,042
 his victim becomes a Yaki.

119
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,920
And how did he get here?

120
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,851
We do not yet know.

121
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,350
 Somehow the Yakis are getting to earth

122
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:03,328
Ow-

123
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Where am I?

124
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:07,751
Who are you?

125
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:10,196
Surrender to Kido the destroyer!

126
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:12,389
Or I'll be forced to obliterate you!

127
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,198
Right. But you brought this on yourselves

128
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,938
He's not much of a destroyer

129
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,300
Do not be alarmed!

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,319
Wou are on planet Earth

131
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,289
They turned you into a Yaki

132
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:31,609
On.... earth?

133
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:33,481
I have to get back to the village!

134
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,767
And you will.

135
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:38,325
But I need you to take these warriors with you

136
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,175
What?

137
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:43,199
You must find Sidmodius, and destroy

138
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,996
Sestrad's Chest

139
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,895
And only you can do it

140
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,507
Here.

141
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,107
These will be your new wristbands

142
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:10,126
Ah! What is that?

143
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,574
Get it off me!

144
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,037
You will go with them.

145
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,500
You know too much. Besides, I saw you fight

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,965
the yaki. You are fast and intelligent

147
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,908
You're kidding me, right?

148
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,170
I'm sorry I'm not taking orders from a

149
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,856
gnome

150
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,193
Yeah, it's better you stay here

151
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,628
These missions can be dangerous.

152
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Really?

153
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,310
In that case, you'll need someone to keep

154
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,924
an eye on you

155
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,600
Alright, I accept

156
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:54,363
So, I guess we're not
going to the movies, right?

157
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,400
Not today

158
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,685
But don't worry!

159
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,551
I'm sure I can "find" more tickets

160
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,975
Okay, guys

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,936
How about instead of

162
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,888
turning into responsible students,

163
00:11:04,913 --> 00:11:08,969
We turn into Sendokai warriors!

164
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,197
Yeah!

165
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:26,492
Yes, Lula! A new adventure has begun.
