1
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,196
Sidmodius has lost
control over Sestrads Chest

2
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:42,355
He has become a superior of super yaki

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,610
Uh oh, He's coming towards us!

4
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,053
Get out of here, quickly!

5
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:22,756
Chloe! Let's use the Duo-Sen Lightning
to snatch the rock out of his hands

6
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:30,540
Duo-Sen-

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,190
Duo-Sen Wall!

8
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,599
Chloe

9
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,567
I think we will only
be able to activate the

10
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:00,240
Lightning Bolt once we're...

11
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,182
We're honest with each other

12
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:02,723
Zack!

13
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,097
That's what I've been trying
to tell you for a long time

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,850
I... I...

15
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,105
I love you

16
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:13,438
Chloe- I-

17
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,899
Oh no! SidYaki is going to destroy Masara!

18
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:25,630
That's not going to happen. Come on, guys!

19
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,190
Nero-Sen Fusion!

20
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,892
We can't do it

21
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,305
Run!

22
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Zack!

23
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:46,105
You have the most
powerful weapon in Masara.

24
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,184
Danima's Map

25
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,223
It's not a regular map.

26
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:56,560
It can gather all the
sen of all the Masarians

27
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
And project it in a single attack

28
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,494
Only a true Hakuru can do it

29
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,630
Inhabitants of Masara!

30
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:20,703
Yes you have suffered, and you are scared

31
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,871
But I need you to transfer
your Sen Energy to me

32
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,343
Do it for Danima!

33
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,173
For Masara!

34
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,992
But above all. Do it for each other

35
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,090
Because only by joining our forces

36
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,050
Will we win

37
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,950
Let's go, Masarians!

38
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:06,714
Nero-Sen Fusion!

39
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,815
Goodbye, Sidmodius!

40
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,610
We won....

41
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,950
We won!

42
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,864
Guys! Something bad has happened

43
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,666
Tampo! What happened?

44
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,594
The old portal has stopped working

45
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:09,598
You can only go back
through the hole that the

46
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:12,210
Chronan-Yatt opened to transport the

47
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,389
Yaquis

48
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,849
The problem is that

49
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:15,422
What?!

50
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,567
It's closing.

51
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:25,679
There it is!

52
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,010
Bye, guys! We will not forget you

53
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,070
Quickly! These wings are
not going to last much longer

54
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,016
It's Lon!

55
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,443
Lon! We gotta get out of here!

56
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,459
Get away from me!

57
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,025
Lon, you have to come with us!
Or you will be trapped in the past!

58
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:49,563
Let go of the helmet and
give me your other hand!

59
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,610
You're still our friend, Lon!

60
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,596
I'm not Lon anymore...

61
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,296
No!

62
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,343
We have to get out of here!

63
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:32,170
The portal is gonna close!

64
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,438
Let's use the Fusion to open it!

65
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,499
Zack! How are we going to go through
the portal while using the Fusion?

66
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:05,679
You need to make the
best decision for your team

67
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,659
Even if it's not the best for you

68
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,544
Guys! Go through! I'll
stay here and keep it open

69
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,131
But-But what about you?

70
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:20,201
Don't worry about me, I'll follow you

71
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,557
Where are Zack and Chloe?!

72
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,816
Chloe!

73
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,210
But how are you going to follow us

74
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,702
If you're stuck here keeping
it open with <i>The Fusion</i>?

75
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,115
You lied to us!

76
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,900
We're going to sacrifice you

77
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,995
No!

78
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,890
You have to go back to earth!

79
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,399
I don't care about earth
and I don't care that

80
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:19,850
you don't feel the same
for me that I feel for you

81
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,397
But I can't leave you

82
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,414
Chloe! You have to get out of here!

83
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,461
If anything happens to you
I will never forgive myself

84
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,259
Because...

85
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:32,903
What?

86
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,885
Because I...

87
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,760
I love you

88
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,530
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

89
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,326
Man, I miss Zack and Chloe

90
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,786
Yeah, me too

91
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,009
Since they started dating,
they've become inseparable

92
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,411
Hey, that's not true!

93
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,373
The four of us see each other every day,

94
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:07,988
Yeah, but today you're both
going to the movies without us

95
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,680
We've this appointment
pending for a long time

96
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:14,057
See you at the exit.

97
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:17,552
"Oh, my love! Let's go
for a walk on the beach."

98
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,329
Remind me never to fall in love

99
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,903
Don't always be so tough

100
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,083
If deep down
you're a romantic

101
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,430
Ouch!

102
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,693
You think we'll like it?

103
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:35,260
Why do you ask?

104
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:38,330
Well, I like video games and

105
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,880
you like art and things like that

106
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,195
We're so different

107
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,538
Wait a minute, are you
talking about the movie

108
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:50,706
or are you talking about-

109
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:54,345
Shut up and enjoy the movie

110
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:22,300
Wow! That was incredible!

111
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,430
You saw the chase! And the end

112
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:28,740
All those things exploding with a BOOM!

113
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,501
And what can you say
about the photography!

114
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:34,142
And the script, the
characters, their stories!

115
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,784
I loved it! It was so....

116
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:38,901
Exciting!

117
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,250
What the heck?

118
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,525
I have waited for this
moment for millions of years!

119
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,407
Lon!

120
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,634
Come with me, my love

121
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:39,340
I will lay the multiverse at your feet!

122
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Zack!

123
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,498
Chloe!

124
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:21,787
And so, the story of the
Sendokai Warriors has come to an end

125
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:27,365
What?! Lon conquered the Multiverse?

126
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,723
And what happens to Zack and Chloe?

127
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,255
It can't end like this!

128
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,834
It's okay! It doesn't end like that!

129
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:40,992
Speak.

130
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:46,216
The story of Zack and Chloe
continues

131
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:52,205
And they lived adventures so
incredible that you couldn't believe them

132
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,310
But if you really want to know more

133
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,446
You will have to wish
for it with all your might
