1
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,196
Sidmodius has lost control over Sestrads Chest

2
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:42,355
He has become a superior of super yaki

3
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,610
Un oh, He's coming towards us!

4
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,053
Get out of here, quickly!

5
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:22,756
Chloe! Let's use the Duo-Sen Lightning to snatch the rock out of his hands

6
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:30,540
Duo-Sen-

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,190
Duo-Sen Wall!

8
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:01,697
Chloe. I think we will only be able to activate the Lightning Bolt once we're honest with each other

9
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:02,723
Zack!

10
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,097
That's what I've been trying to tell you for a long time

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,850
I... I...

12
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,105
I love you

13
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:13,438
Chloe- I-

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,544
Oh no! SidYaki is going to destroy Masara!

15
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,630
That's not going to happen. Come on, guys!

16
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,190
Nero-Sen Fusion!

17
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,892
We can't do it

18
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,305
Run!!!

19
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Zack!

20
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:46,105
You have the most powerful weapon in Masara.

21
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,184
Danima's Map

22
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:53,223
It's not a regular map.

23
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:56,560
It can gather all the sen of all the Masarians

24
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
And project it in a single attack

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,494
Only a true Hakuru can do it

26
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,630
Inhabitants of Masara!

27
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:20,703
Yes you have suffered, and you are scared

28
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:24,871
But I need you to transfer your Sen Energy to me

29
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,343
Do it for Danima!

30
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,173
For Masara!

31
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,992
But above all. Do it for each other

32
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,090
Because only by joining our forces

33
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,050
Will we win

34
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,950
Let's go, Masarians!

35
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:06,240
Nero-Sen Fusion!

36
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,815
Goodbye, Sidmodius!

37
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,610
We won....

38
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,950
We won!

39
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,864
Guys! Something bad has happened

40
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,940
Tampo! What happend?

41
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,140
The old portal has stopped working

42
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,598
You can only go back through the hole that the

43
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:12,210
Chronan-Yatt opened to transport the

44
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,389
Yaquis

45
00:07:13,414 --> 00:07:14,849
The problem is that

46
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:15,422
What?!

47
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,567
It's closing.

48
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:25,679
There it is!

49
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,010
Bye, guys! We will not forget you

50
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,070
Quickly! These wings are not going to last much longer

51
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,016
It's Lon!

52
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,443
Lon! We gotta get out of here!

53
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,459
Get away from me!

54
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,106
Lon, you have to

55
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,600
come with us or you will be

56
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,109
trapped in the past

57
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:49,563
Let go of the helmet and give me your other hand!

58
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,610
You're still our friend, Lon!

59
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,596
I'm not Lon anymore...

60
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,296
No!

61
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,343
We have to get out of here!

62
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:32,170
The portal is gonna close!

63
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,438
Let's use the Fusion to open it!

64
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,499
Zack! How are we going to go through the portal while using the Fusion?

65
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:05,679
You need to make the best decision for your team

66
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,659
Even if it's not the best for you

67
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:14,544
Guys! Go through! I'll stay here and keep it open

68
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,131
But-But what about you?

69
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:20,201
Don't worry about me, I'll follow you

70
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,557
Where are Zack and Chloe?!

71
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,816
Chloe!

72
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,210
But how are you going to follow us

73
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,702
If you're stuck here keeping it open?

74
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,115
You lied to us!

75
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,900
We're going to sacrifice you

76
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,995
No!

77
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,890
You have to go back to earth!

78
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:19,850
I don'tcare about earth and I don't care that you don't feel the same for me that I feel for you

79
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,397
But I can't leave you

80
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,414
Chloe! You have to get out of here!

81
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:30,461
If anything happens to you I will never forgive myself

82
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:31,083
Because...

83
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:32,903
why

84
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,885
Because I...

85
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,760
I love you

86
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,530
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

87
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,326
Yeah, me too

88
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,786
Yeah, me too

89
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,009
way to meet them. Don't

90
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,411
Hey, don't lie!

91
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:03,373
If the four of us see each other every day,

92
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:07,988
Yeah, but today you're both going to the movies without us

93
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,680
We've this appointment pending for a long time

94
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:14,057
See you at the exit.

95
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:18,570
Let's go for a walk on the beach.

96
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,329
Remember me never to fall in love

97
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,480
always be tough, if deep down

98
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,083
you're a romantic,

99
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,910
you think we'll like it because you say it,

100
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,330

101
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,040

109
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,430
you saw the chase and the end

110
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,450
all those things exploding with a pub

111
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,880
and what can you say about the photography and the

112
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,790
script the characters their stories

113
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,990

[Applause]

117
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,330
although I waited for this moment for

118
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,680
millions of years

119
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,080
yes

120
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,680

[Applause]

127
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,569

tokai came to  Its end

129
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,140

but if you really want to know more

134
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,130
