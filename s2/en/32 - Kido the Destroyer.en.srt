1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,920
Quick!

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Hurry up! My people need help!

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,960
You know, Masara is giving
me a really familiar feeling.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Yeah.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,840
It's called being tired.
I get that on earth, too.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,720
Hey, Kido.
Is it much further?

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,855
No. We have to cross the plane of hard
Rock.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,054
It's a little desert.

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
It should only take three days.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,600
What?

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Come on.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,831
Don't just stand there!

13
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,560
Kido! We can't walk through a desert
for three days. We'll get dehydrated!

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,842
Do what I do.
Lick your own sweat.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Very well.

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,120
If you prefer, we could use these.

17
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,637
They're skimmers. The
<i>Droovers</i> left them here when

18
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:42,225
they completed their
training with Danima

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,166
You have to charge them up
with your own energy.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Whoa!

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Guys!

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,480
Is it just me,
or is this gonna totally rock?

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah!

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Ha ha ha ha!

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Look out! You ruffians! <i>Kido The Destroyer</i>
is about to make mincemeat off you!

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,554
You think I could drive?

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,720
It's okay. I got it. You
can get some rest.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Don't you trust me?

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,878
Of course I trust you.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,696
Hey, guys. Last one to
the big rock is a loser!

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,097
Can't you any faster, "Hakuru"?

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Leave this to me.

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,640
No! Kido wait! Oh!

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,775
Tanpo the Wadan

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Lalit.

36
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Welcome to the Great Tower of Beldzar.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
How can I help you?

38
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,840
Your Majesty, Sidmodius is still alive! and
has traveled to a dimension named Masara.

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,960
We had never heard of this place before.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,040
And we do not know why
Sidmodius has gone there.

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,920
We have come in search of answers.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Then you have come to the right place.

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,360
Scribe.

44
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,160
I have work for you.

45
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,720
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,680
The day you offered me sanctuary,

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,560
I swore loyalty to you
and to this library.

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,840
It will be my pleasure to help you.

49
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Thank you.

50
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
But it is not for myself I ask.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
I wish you to help our guests.

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,000
Lilith and your brother Tambo.

53
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Hello, Kento.

54
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,960
But I am afraid I can do nothing for them.

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
If tempo needs to consult the library,

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
he can do it himself. Oh.

58
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Over there.

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Oh, no.

60
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
This is horrible.

61
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Hello. Hello?

62
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,440
Is anyone.

63
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
There?

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Father.

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,680
Said Mobius
has turned them all into Yuki's,

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
and he's taken them with him.

67
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,080
I don't think they've gone.

68
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Look at the footprints.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,640
We're surrounded.

70
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
By. Oh!

71
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Beautiful.

72
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,400
Oh. Oh!

73
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Tai santo.

74
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Koa. Soon you.

75
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Soon.

76
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Loan.

77
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Let's use the Duo and force.

78
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
There's nothing we can do.

79
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Coward! Go!

80
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Here we go. Oh!

81
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,120
Oh, no!

82
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,440
Oh! Oh!

83
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,880
Oh! Yes!

84
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Loaded.

85
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,320
Kino.

86
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Now's our chance.

87
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,320
Yeah!

88
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
Duo send force.

89
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah. Yes.

90
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
Whoa!

91
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,240
Kido! Father!

92
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Luke!

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
What are you doing with my crown?

94
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,880
You. Who were you?

95
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
They friends of mine.

96
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
They freed you?

97
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
Did they really?

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Boy. Corinthian.

99
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Prepare a banquet for, loaded guests.

100
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:30,040
What's, Oh!

101
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
Oh, you clumsy oaf!

102
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Even as a servant, you're a failure.

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,920
And you say this seed
mode is transformed. So.

104
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't believe it.

105
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,520
It must be those
yellow bellied grow beards.

106
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,400
So I think it was the contacts.

107
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
Nonsense.

108
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,520
It was the fumes
race, crawling with those creeps.

109
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
No, no! Stop it!

110
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
You're wasting time

111
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,440
fighting amongst yourselves
when you should be standing together.

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,680
Besides, Kato's not clumsy.

113
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,200
He fought alongside us.

114
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,720
He helped release you all.

115
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,320
Tito.

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,320
Don't make me love.

117
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
The only thing he's ever released is gas.

118
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,520
We call him Kido.

119
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,520
The stinger.

120
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,760
If only he was the Yaqui.

121
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,040
No. He's brothers.

122
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
Tito.

123
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,920
Pull me another.

124
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Drink. No.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,280
I've had enough.

126
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
What?

127
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm going to save Kanan the key way.

128
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,360
And prove that I, too,
am fit to be a warrior.

129
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,920
You can't go.

130
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,640
Who do the cooking?

131
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Get your crown to do it.

132
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,360
Well said.

133
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Dude.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You want to drive?

135
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah.

136
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
Whoa!

137
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
What was I thinking? Oh.

138
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,440
You're right.

139
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
There is something familiar about Mazara.

140
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
It's almost like we've been here before.

141
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
The moon.

142
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,400
Have you found something?

143
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,000
And the gods of the sin
filled the sky with clouds.

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
And when their work was done,

145
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,080
they created the sun and the moon.

146
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
This was the origin of Mazara.

147
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Long before the dark Genesis.

148
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,600
Long before it became known.

149
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Us planet Earth.

150
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,040
But all the gods.

151
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,000
Sid mojitos.

152
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And the youngsters
didn't travel to another dimension.

153
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,440
They traveled in time.

154
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Exactly.

155
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,800
Mazara is us.

156
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
In the past.
