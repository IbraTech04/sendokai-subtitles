00:09:55,000 --> 00:010:11,000
it. You're wasting time fighting amongst yourselves. When you should be standing together. Besides Ketos not clumsy. He fought alongside us. He helped release you all. Tito

1
00:011:17,000 --> 00:011:35,000
What was I think? You're right. There is something familiar about Massara. It's almost like we've been here before

1
00:011:35,000 --> 00:011:37,000
the moon have you found something.

1
00:011:37,000 --> 00:012:03,000
And the gods of the sun filled the sky with clouds. And when their work was done, they created the sun and the moon. This was the origin of Massara long before the dark Genesis, long before it became known as Planet Earth.

1
00:012:03,000 --> 00:012:11,000
By all the gods fit modius and the youngsters didn't travel to another dimension. They traveled in time.

1
00:012:11,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Exactly. Massara is Earth in the past
