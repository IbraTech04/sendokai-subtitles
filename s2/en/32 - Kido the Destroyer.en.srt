1
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,920
Quick!

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Hurry up! My people need help!

3
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,960
You know, Masara is giving
me a really familiar feeling.

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,720
Yeah.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,840
It's called being tired.
I get that on earth, too.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,720
Hey, Kido.
Is it much further?

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,855
No. We have to cross the plane of hard
Rock.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,054
It's a little desert.

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
It should only take three days.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,600
What?

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Come on.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,831
Don't just stand there!

13
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,560
Kido! We can't walk through a desert
for three days. We'll get dehydrated!

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,842
Do what I do.
Lick your own sweat.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Very well.

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,120
If you prefer, we could use these.

17
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,637
They're skimmers. The
<i>Droovers</i> left them here when

18
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:42,225
they completed their
training with Danima

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,166
You have to charge them up
with your own energy.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Whoa!

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Guys!

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,480
Is it just me,
or is this gonna totally rock?

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah!

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Ha ha ha ha!

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Look out! You ruffians! <i>Kido The Destroyer</i>
is about to make mincemeat off you!

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,554
You think I could drive?

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,720
It's okay. I got it. You
can get some rest.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,800
Don't you trust me?

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,878
Of course I trust you.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,696
Hey, guys. Last one to
the big rock is a loser!

31
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,097
Can't you any faster, "Hakuru"?

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Leave this to me.

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,640
No! Kido wait! Oh!

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,775
Tanpo the Wadan

35
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Lalit.

36
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Welcome to the Great Tower of Beldzar.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
How can I help you?

38
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,840
Your Majesty, Sidmodius is still alive! and
has traveled to a dimension named Masara.

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,960
We had never heard of this place before.

40
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,040
And we do not know why
Sidmodius has gone there.

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,920
We have come in search of answers.

42
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Then you have come to the right place.

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Scribe.
I have work for you.

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,441
Your Majesty. The day
you offered me sanctuary,

45
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:42,560
I swore loyalty to
you and to this library.

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,840
It will be my pleasure to help you.

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Thank you.

48
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
But it is not for myself I ask.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
I wish you to help our guests.

50
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,295
Lalith and your brother Tanpo.

51
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,755
Hello, Kento.

52
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,621
I am sorry, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,960
But I am afraid I can do nothing for them.

54
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,641
If Tanpo needs to consult the library,
he can do it himself.

55
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Over there!

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,928
Oh, no.

57
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
This is horrible.

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Hello. Hello?

59
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,440
Is anyone there?

60
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
Father.

61
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,200
Sidmodius has turned them all into
Yakis and he's taken them with him.

62
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,792
I don't think they've gone.
Look at the footprints.

63
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:28,758
We're surrounded!

64
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,815
Tai-Sen Trail!

65
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,446
Goa-Sen Sheild!

66
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:17,163
Lon, Let's use
the Duo and force.

67
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,394
There's nothing we can do.

68
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,353
Coward

69
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,220
Here we go.

70
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:01,436
Look out!

71
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,145
Yes!

72
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,770
Lon! Kido! Now's our chance.

73
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
Duo-Sen Force!

74
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,404
Yes!

75
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,760
Whoa!

76
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,774
Kido?

77
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,240
Father!

78
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
Luke!

79
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
What are you doing with my crown?

80
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:09,880
Who are you?

81
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
They're friends of mine!

82
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
They freed you?

83
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
Did they really?

84
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Boy. Corinthian.

85
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,172
Prepare a banquet for
our honored guests at once!

86
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
Oh, you clumsy oaf!

87
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Even as a servant, you're a failure.

88
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,920
And you say this, "Sidmodius"
transformed us all?

89
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't believe it!

90
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,520
It must be those
yellow bellied grow beards.

91
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,400
So I think it was the Kurtacks!

92
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,560
Nonsense.

93
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,520
It was the flumes!
Masara's crawling with those creeps.

94
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,374
No, no!

95
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,640
Stop it!

96
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,975
You're wasting time fighting amongst yourselves
when you should be standing together.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,456
Besides, Kido's not clumsy. He fought
alongside us. He helped release you all.

98
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:10,403
Kido?

99
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:14,295
Don't make me laugh!

100
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
 he only thing he's ever released is gas.

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,705
We call him <i>Kido. The Stinker</i>

102
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,040
If only he was the Yaki.
Not his brothers.

103
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,849
Kido, pour me another drink

104
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:34,920
No!

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,280
I've had enough.

106
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
What?

107
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm going to save Keenan and Kiway! And
prove that I, too, am fit to be a warrior.

108
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,920
You can't go.

109
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,640
Who'll do the cooking?

110
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Get your crown to do it.

111
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,903
Well said, dude.

112
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,032
You wanna drive?

113
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,440
Yeah.

114
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
Whoa!

115
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,840
What was I thinking?

116
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,440
You're right.

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
There is something familiar about Masara.

118
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
It's almost like we've been here before.

119
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
The moon.

120
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,400
Have you found something?

121
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,174
And the gods of the sen
filled the sky with clouds.

122
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
And when their work was done,

123
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,622
they created the sun and the moon.

124
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,120
This was the origin of Masara.

125
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Long before the dark Genesis.

126
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,600
Long before it became
known. as planet Earth.

127
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:09,255
By all the gods! Sidmodius and the
youngsters didn't travel to another dimension.

128
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,440
They traveled in time!

129
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Exactly.

130
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,800
Masara is earth

131
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,246
In the past.
