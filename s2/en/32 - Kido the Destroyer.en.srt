1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,760

00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,050
quickly, hurry up, my people need

3
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,960
help, God, there's something about going through the one that

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,300
seems very familiar to me. It's the damn

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,360
holes in the ground. We also have, hey, there's still a long way to go.

6
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,190
Don't just

7
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,070
cross the small desert. Let's take a little

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,460
walk.

9
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,210
It'll be three days of nothing. Let's

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,649
go.  You want us standing, we can't

11
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:21,710
walk for three days in the desert, we

12
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,220

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,090
our sweat

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,460
and that's fine, if you want, we can use those, they

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,729
are sliders. The drivers left them

16
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:44,000
here when they completed their contaminated training

17
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,630
and

18
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,800
you have to charge them with your energy.

19
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,040

whoever sent me,

105
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,850
it's true, there is something in Massara that

106
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,449
seems familiar to me, it's as if we had

107
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:32,259
been here before,

108
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,440
the moon,

109
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,270
you have found something and the gods of sen

110
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,390
They filled their sky with clouds and when

111
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,680
they were done they created the sun and the

112
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,910
moon.

113
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,390
This was the origin of Masada

114
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,760
long before the dark genesis,

115
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,860
long before it was known as the

116
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,700
earth by all the gods for no reason

117
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,920
and the boys have not traveled to another

118
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,390
dimension.  traveled in

119
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,110
exact time plus now is the earth in the

120
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,920
past

121
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,450
to
