1
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,220
well we have arrived

2
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,940
here the big sitting tournament will be held

3
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,500
the yoga stadium falls na

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,610
have already come to me  I heard that someone was going

5
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,879
to kick the ass without modules and I wanted to

6
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,120
see it in person where so many

7
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,550
percent had a matter to attend to

8
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,640
citizens

9
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,500
but sorry I just arrived

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,350
citizens of Pasara welcome to the

11
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,310
first big tournament

12
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,680
we are about to meet

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
s

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,720
the classification in the first fight

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,230
the team will face each other

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,660
they are all girls this is going to be a piece of cake

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,829
I like the style of those girls if they are

18
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:18,469
strong but let's see who is the best

19
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,860
group  on my feet

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,510
who was suffering absent

21
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,310
thinking about a tactic for combat if it

22
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,239
is very noticeable

23
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,680
you know maybe it is not so bad to live

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,680
like this paying like a wolf I sing like a lion

25
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,120
smelling like an atmosphere

26
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,420
if I have noticed it too

27
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,000
careful what are you doing here look for my

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,150
brothers and what are you doing here you should

29
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,110
be with your team

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,400
I no longer have a team

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,910
final

32
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,120
haha ​​let it

33
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,650
start to be

34
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,140
but they are powerful gains

35
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,510
on the shoulders

36
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,170
yes

37
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,230
ah

38
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:56,430
for the

39
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,610
well

40
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,830
now we do have equipment for the

41
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,949
tournament

42
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:31,189
although we could use one more warrior,

43
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,470
I can fight with them, they

44
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,650
already hit your head and  Heilbronn has been able to

45
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,620
save himself, he can fight us in a tournament

46
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,160
if he doesn't participate, we are not

47
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,560
perfect either. I have always said that he had a

48
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,349
chance, although we will still

49
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,900
need another one from Reggio in case

50
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,030
someone gets injured,

51
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,500
he could fight with us. I, today it is

52
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,610
impossible, I no longer.  I am a warrior

53
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,790
being a street of misunderstandings

54
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,660
a warrior being here and it is for

55
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,840
life

56
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,740
as long as maximum humans will be

57
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,129
defeated

58
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,419
the end guys no or chloé things have

59
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,909
changed but you can't stay stuck

60
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,879
in the past because here and now you still

61
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,289
have a team

62
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,000
and

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,450
a partner to trust

64
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,380
here and now

65
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,880
2

66
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,339
no [

67
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,570
tecos

68
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,280
see we beat the girls yes and you know

69
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,380
why because two girls we have

70
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,790
saved you  the skin

71
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,350
a good fight

72
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,020
by the way I like your style

73
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,660
what are you doing here you have to

74
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,490
participate again in the big tournament without you we will not

75
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,190
be able to stop or without means I have left

76
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,170
the kylie and I have new friends

77
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,200
but that is a  little your true

78
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,720
friends are fighting to save the

79
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,290
world you don't understand I have

80
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,080
endangered the people I love leave you

81
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,930
Duke Simó God had his way and

82
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,330
because of me

83
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
death itself

84
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,310
is horrible things no one is going to

85
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,840
forgive me

86
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,170
but I have  said no

87
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,430
you're a coward you

88
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,310
don't know what it's like to feel like a

89
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,610
monster I enslave

90
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,640
entire dimensions and still the people who

91
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,699
really cared forgive me you

92
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:49,660
know your friends will forgive you but

93
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,590
that's not what you fear, right?

94
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,790
You blame yourself for the girl's death but

95
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,030
she's not here to forgive you and you have to

96
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,939
live with that

97
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,409
I just wanted to be a good choir you

98
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,310
said

99
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,630
I just want to be a good insurance I

100
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,880
really want to be a good insurance

101
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,110
in that  case

102
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,960
he accepts the pain and fights again

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,120
as Danny would have wanted

104
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,779
although for that you

105
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:38,890
have to be brave

106
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,090
and in the next

107
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,160
and

108
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,910
this baron reigns here sounds like

109
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,170
something to me

110
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,749
anyway, let the pse begin to

111
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,100
give him what he deserves

112
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,279
and this has become very strong we are the

113
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,950
only hope for more I'm afraid

114
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,120
you're wrong

115
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,460
in reality to both

116
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,910
attention please

117
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,600
well
