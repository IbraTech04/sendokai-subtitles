1
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,249
Well, we're here!

2
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,241
This is where the great
Sendokai tournament will be held

3
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,327
The Shohanan Stadium

4
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,776
Lalith!

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,275
You're here?

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,049
I heard that someone was going to
kick Sidmodius' butt

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,491
and I wanted to see it for myself.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,579
 Where are Tanpo and Kento?

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,219
They had business to attend to.

10
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,772
Citizens of Manara!

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>Masara</i>

12
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,163
Sorry, I just got here.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,163
Citizens of Masara!

14
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,803
Welcome to the first great Sendokai tournament!

15
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,287
Yeah!

16
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:44,809
We are about to find out the
first-round matchups, which

17
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:49,098
will be held behind closed
doors and without spectators.

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,179
At first base, facing the pitcher.

19
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,785
They're all girls.

20
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,999
This is going to be a piece of cake.

21
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,719
I like the style of those girls.

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,839
Yeah, they're strong, but...

23
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,159
Let's see who's best
with a do on their feet.

24
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:29,836
Cloe!

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,079
You seem distracted.

26
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,679
Thinking up a tactic
for combat?

27
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,516
Yes, is it that obvious?

28
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,365
You know what?

29
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,649
Maybe it's not
so bad living like this.

30
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,529
Wandering like a wolf.

31
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,649
Hunting like a lion.

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,559
Smelling like a skunk.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,779
Yes, I've noticed that too.

34
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,059
What

35
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:09,776
Kido!

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,675
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,930
Looking for my brothers.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,419
And what are you doing here?

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,099
Shouldn't you be with your team?

40
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,329
I don't have a team anymore.

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,199
Yakis!

42
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,123
Keenan!

43
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,139
Keeway!

44
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,471
Let the Sendokai begin!

45
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:16,736
The Humans are ahead of the game!

46
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:21,628
Tai-Sen Trail!

47
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,584
Wow! The Nero armor has made us more powerful!

48
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:38,299
Kai for the humans!

49
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:39,861
Yes!

50
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:45,447
They counterattack!

51
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,604
Cloe! Stop them!

52
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:09,401
Kai!

53
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,611
Now we have a team for the tournament!

54
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:30,018
Although we could really use another warrior.

55
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,290
I can fight them!

56
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:37,797
What? Did you hit
your head in the jungle?

57
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:42,145
If he could save us.
He can fight in a tournament.

58
00:05:43,963 --> 00:05:47,010
If he doesn't participate, neither will we!

59
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:53,265
Perfect! I've always
said you had potential.

60
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,849
Although we'll still need another
warrior in case someone gets injured.

61
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,494
Zak can fight with us!

62
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,074
Me?

63
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:04,588
Impossible!

64
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm no longer a Sendokai warrior

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,307
You're wrong, Za.

66
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,713
A Sendokai Warrior is a warrior for life.

67
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,822
Goa-Sen Shield!

68
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,026
Dea-Sen Dagger!

69
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,791
Kai!

70
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,195
One more, and the
humans will be defeated!

71
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,252
It's over, guys.

72
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,746
No, Cloe!

73
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,829
Things have changed.

74
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,369
But you can't stay
stuck in the past.

75
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,869
Because here and now,
you still have a team.

76
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,459
A nd a partner you can trust.

77
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,330
No! Here and now!

78
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,658
Here!

79
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:27,752
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

80
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:59,901
Kai for the humans!

81
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:06,034
Incredible! The humans win the Sendokai!

82
00:08:08,143 --> 00:08:10,143
Yes guys!

83
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:12,713
Yeah!

84
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,643
See? We beat the girls.

85
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:26,346
Yes. And do you know why?
Because two girls saved our skins

86
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:33,455
Good fight. By the way, I like your style.

87
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,096
What are you doing here?

88
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:44,394
You have to participate in
the great tournament again.

89
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:48,459
Without you, we won't
be able to stop Sidmodius

90
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,972
I've left the Sendokai and...

91
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,034
I have new friends.

92
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,254
That?

93
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,825
Is that a coconut?

94
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,720
Your real friends are
fighting to save the world.

95
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,089
You don't understand.

96
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,605
I've endangered
the people I love.

97
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,308
I let Sidmodius
get away with it.

98
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,989
And because of me...

99
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,767
Danima is dead!

100
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:19,575
I've done horrible things.
No one will forgive me.

101
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,099
But-

102
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,507
I said no!

103
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,560
You're a coward!

104
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:34,775
You don't know what it's like
to feel like a monster.

105
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:44,459
I enslaved entire dimensions. And yet,
the people who really cared forgave me.

106
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,989
You know your friends
will forgive you.

107
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,649
But that's what
you're afraid of?

108
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,986
Right?

109
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,954
You blame yourself for
Danima's death.

110
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:03,168
But she's not here to forgive
you. And you have to live with that.

111
00:10:04,206 --> 00:10:07,582
I just wanted to be
a good Hakuro.

112
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,353
What did you say?

113
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,769
That I just want to
be a good Hakuro.

114
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,439
Do you really want to
be a good Hakuro?

115
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:25,101
In that case... Accept
the pain and fight again!

116
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,474
Just as Danima would have wanted.

117
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:38,741
But for that, you really have to be brave

118
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:57,543
And in the next match, The
Drubers will face Baron Raknaki!

119
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,606
This "Baron
Raknaki" rings a bell

120
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,669
Anyway.

121
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:06,482
Let the Sendokai begin!

122
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,178
Come on, Drubers! Give
him what he deserves.

123
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,448
Let's go, Drubers!

124
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,854
Duo-Sen Fury!

125
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,189
Sid-Sen Rage!

126
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:06,517
Baron just won the Sendokai with one shot!

127
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
I haven't seen anything like this!

128
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:16,755
Damn, he's really strong

129
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,395
We are Masara's only
hope.

130
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,659
I'm afraid you're mistaken

131
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,312
Actually, there's another one

132
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,085
Attention, please!

133
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:38,470
A new warrior has invoked Chronian's
Law, and will join Team Kiwun!
