1
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,249
Well, we're here!

2
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,241
This is where the great
Sendokai tournament will be held

3
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,327
The Shohanan Stadium

4
00:00:57,585 --> 00:00:58,776
Lalith!

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,275
You're here?

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,049
I heard that someone was going to
kick Sidmodius' butt

7
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,491
and I wanted to see it for myself.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,579
 Where are Tampo and Kento?

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,219
They had business to attend to.

10
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,772
Citizens of Manara!

11
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>Masara</i>

12
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,163
Sorry, I just got here.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,163
Citizens of Masara!

14
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,803
Welcome to the first great Sendokai tournament!

15
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,287
Yeah!

16
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,179
At first base, facing the pitcher.

17
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,785
They're all girls.

18
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,999
This is going to be a piece of cake.

19
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,719
I like the style of those girls.

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,839
Yeah, they're strong, but...

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,159
Let's see who's best
with a do on their feet.

22
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:29,836
Cloe!

23
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,079
You seem distracted.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,679
Thinking up a tactic
for combat?

25
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,516
Yes, is it that obvious?

26
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,365
You know what?

27
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,649
Maybe it's not
so bad living like this.

28
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,529
Wandering like a wolf.

29
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,649
Hunting like a lion.

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,559
Smelling like a skunk.

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,779
Yes, I've noticed that too.

32
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,059
What

33
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:09,776
Kido!

34
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,675
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,930
Looking for my brothers.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,419
And what are you doing here?

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,099
Shouldn't you be with your team?

38
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,329
I don't have a team anymore.

39
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,199
Yakis!

40
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,123
Keenan!

41
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,139
Kiway!

42
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,471
Let the Sendokai begin!

43
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,584
Wow! The Nero armor has made us more powerful!

44
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:40,065
If he could save us.

45
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,145
He can fight in a tournament.

46
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,459
Neither can we!

47
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,569
I said you had
a chance.

48
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,879
Although we'll still need
another warrior in case

49
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,849
someone gets injured.

50
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,199
Me?

51
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,359
Impossible!

52
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,659
I'm no longer a
warrior, Sendokai.

53
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,379
You're wrong, Za.

54
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,219
But Sendokai is for
life.

55
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,819
It's over, guys.

56
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,829
Things have changed.

57
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,369
But you can't stay
stuck in the past.

58
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,869
Because here and now,
you still have a team.

59
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,459
Who can you trust?

60
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,819
We've been saved.

61
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,249
You have to get back to
participating in the big picture.

62
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,459
We won't be able to stop
Sid Modius.

63
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,779
I've left the Sendokai and...

64
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,839
I have new friends.

65
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,189
That?

66
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,549
Is that a coconut?

67
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,349
Your real friends are
fighting to save the world.

68
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,089
You don't understand.

69
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:05,069
I've endangered
the people I love.

70
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,308
I let Sid Modius
get away with it.

71
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,989
And because of me...

72
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,379
Danima is dead!

73
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,779
I've done horrible things.

74
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,339
No one will forgive me.

75
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,099
But-

76
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,724
I said no!

77
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:31,379
He's a coward!

78
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,999
He's like a monster!

79
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,619
I enslaved
entire dimensions.

80
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,429
And yet, the people
who really

81
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,459
cared forgave me.

82
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,989
You know your friends
will forgive you.

83
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,649
But that's not what you fear.

84
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,869
Right?

85
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,759
You blame yourself for
Danima's death.

86
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,159
But she's not
here to forgive you.

87
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,039
And you have to live with that.

88
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,349
I just wanted to be
a good Hakuro.

89
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,929
What did you say?

90
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,769
That I just want to
be a good Hakuro.

91
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,089
Do you really want to
be a good Hakuro?

92
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,869
In that case...

93
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,129
Accept the pain
and fight again!

94
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,449
Just as Danima would have wanted.

95
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,269
Because that's what...

96
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,249
You have to be
really brave.

97
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,409
And it rings a bell.

98
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,669
Anyway.

99
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:16,755
Damn, he's really strong

100
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,395
We are Masara's only
hope.

101
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,659
I'm afraid you're mistaken

102
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:25,312
Actually, there's another one

103
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,085
Attention, please!
