1
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,360
You. You. You.

2
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,560
You. You.

3
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,280
Zack. Where's your sister?

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,040
I asked you to watch her. Just a second.

5
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Yes, you did.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,400
One. Calm down.

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,080
It was just a scare.

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Can you tell me what you were thinking? Me.

9
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,760
When you're looking after your sister,
you can't have your mind on other things.

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Well, we're here.

12
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,640
Okay. Tino.

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,760
What's going on?

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,240
The villages further back
are accusing each other of the Yaquis.

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
And of the death of. Niña.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,920
You have. Freed yourselves.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,720
That Yaqui plaque.

18
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,720
You've always wanted our land.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,560
Don't be stupid.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,560
So have we. They attacked us.

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,560
I hate neighborhood meetings.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,880
I see. What are you doing?

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,240
We told you that all this is God's fault.

24
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,200
And I told you that I don't know any God.

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,400
But ever since you arrived
nothing but misfortune has happened.

26
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes. Get out of here, or I'll kick you out.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
But you don't have any legs.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Well, I'll shine really brightly

29
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,840
and it'll sting your eyes.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,560
These kids can't be to blame.

31
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I say it was the deities.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
They're not real Marianas.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
Listen, we've been here for centuries.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
We're as Marian as you are.

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,600
To me, you're invaders.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,360
And I rest my case with the cart.

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,440
You should be ashamed

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
fighting where he just died.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Never mind.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,880
Mi. Everything is going as planned.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Let's get on with the action. Wait.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't be impatient.

43
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,920
Are you okay?

44
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,080
Well, things aren't going very well at home.
45

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
And it doesn't help much here either.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,560
That's not true.

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,920
You're one of us.

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,120
Remember all the battles
we've won.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,120
thanks to you.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
For the people of

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
beyond the horse, it's the most important thing.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
We always settle our
disputes in the field.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Oh, really?

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,480
Yes, yes.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
I referee the fights.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,040
As long as you keep fighting

57
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
among yourselves, you'll be easy prey.

58
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,800
You need a leader.

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,360
Someone you trust.

60
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
How does he encourage you?

61
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,000
Someone

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
who unites you to defeat the Yaquis.

63
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Ah. I would be a good leader. You?

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
I would be a better leader.

65
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
A stone or an energy sphere?

66
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,240
Me. Sandokan.

67
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,040
You Aryans always resolve

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,040
your differences sensibly. No.

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Well, hold a great tournament.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
And let the winner be your leader.

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,520
And he's right.

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
It's true. How did we not think of that before?

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,160
I propose that the chiefs of the villages
get together

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,960
to decide the rules of this tournament.

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
I don't like this.

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Maybe the tournament
wasn't such a good idea.

77
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course it was.

78
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,840
If you hadn't intervened,
this would have ended very badly.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Inhabitants of Mazar.

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
The village leaders.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
We have laid down the following rules.

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Anyone

83
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,120
may participate
in the great tournament of Sendo.

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,600
Whether born in Masada or not,

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,440
as long as there is a period of mourning.

86
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,440
No one will be allowed to fight.

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,440
At the request of the fans,

88
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,200
any warrior may be replaced
by a representative of his choice.

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,520
And finally, and most importantly.

90
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Who wins the tournament?

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
He will be recognized by all the people

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
as the new leader of Masada.

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Very well.

94
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,720
It is hereby announced

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:24,320
the first great local tournament. From.

96
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,280
Now, for

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,200
which town will host the big tournament.

98
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,640
We, the northerners, will host it.

99
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,600
The Keys and the Rovers.

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
And the.

101
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Rápidos.

102
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Go for it.

103
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Escudándose.

104
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
En el.

105
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Shot from.

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Today. But who?

107
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,400
That was close.

108
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,400
These guys are already very dangerous.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, God.

110
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,320
For. Now.

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
What are you doing?

112
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,600
Is God responsible for the attacks?

113
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Don't be silly.

114
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,800
He just saved us.

115
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Many.

116
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,600
You must have me confused with someone else.

117
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,720
I'm the male.

118
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm also entering the big tournament.

119
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,720
So be it.

120
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,280
Damn you.

121
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
It was a great

122
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,520
idea to organize a big tournament.

123
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Thank you very much

124
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:49,600
a. You.

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,800
By the mustache of the queen of hair
and where am I?

126
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
I don't remember anything.

127
00:09:57,120
The one who was missing.

128
00:09:58,720
You're just in time for the big tournament.

129
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
A tournament?

130
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Someone needs an announcer.

131
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Bueno.

132
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Tampoco chicos.

133
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
We have some bad news.

134
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,520
No. We've been traveling back in time.

135
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
The history teacher is going to freak out
when I tell him what it's like.

136
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Now we have to figure out
how he plans to turn

137
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
without Mobius in the Great Storm.

138
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm afraid we already know.

139
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,000
We've just announced
a big hockey tournament that.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
All he has to do is

141
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,640
winning it to seize power.

142
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
It's the worst thing that could happen.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And here it is.

144
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,080
Then there's only one solution.

145
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You'll have to win

146
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,760
the first major hockey tournament

147
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
in history.

148
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll sign us up.

149
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
Pobreza.

150
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
¿Qué ocurre?

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,800
First, he chose her a little
by playing the cradle.

152
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Then he let her slip away to the rhythm of his.

153
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
Things aren't
much better at home either.

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
And now he's the one who's caused
the big tournament.

155
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,400
By the way, you don't sign up

156
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
there.

157
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
And his slider?

158
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
There's a note.

159
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,240
Dear friends, it's all my fault.

160
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
You deserve a better course.

161
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,400
That's why I've decided to leave the team

162
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,760
and not come home.

163
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,160
I'll never forget you.

164
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,400
Zack.
