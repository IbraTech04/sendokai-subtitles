1
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,385
Zak, where's your sister?

2
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,668
I asked you to watch her for just a second.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,528
Yes, you did.

4
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:06,770
Ona!

5
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,856
Calm down

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,080
We were just worried about you

7
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,379
Can you tell me what you were thinking?

8
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,801
When you're looking after your sister,
you can't have your mind on other things.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,575
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,825
Well, we're here-

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,760
Kido, what's going on?

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,375
The villages of Masara are
accusing each other of the Yaquis.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,480
And of the death of Danima

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,695
You have released the Yaki plague!

15
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,720
You've always wanted our land!

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,535
Don't be stupid.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,989
We've been attacked too!

18
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,879
I hate neighborhood meetings.

19
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:13,605
<i>Don't like to me</i>

20
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you doing?

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,240
We told you that all
this is Sidmodius' fault!

22
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:22,200
And I told you that I
don't know any Sidmodius!

23
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,400
But ever since you arrived nothing
but misfortune has happened.

24
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:32,255
Yes. Get out of here, or I'll kick you out.

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
But you don't have any legs.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,263
Well, I'll shine really brightly
and it'll sting your eyes.

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,615
These kids can't be to blame.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I say it was the Deades!

29
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,895
They're not real Masarians!

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
Listen, we've been here for centuries.

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
We're as Masarian as you are.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,560
To me, you are invaders, and
I deal with invadors with war!

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,036
You should be ashamed,
fighting where Danima just died.

34
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:31,005
Everything is going as planned.

35
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,481
Let's get on with the action

36
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,810
Wait, don't be impatient.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,770
Are you okay, Zak?

38
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:52,080
Well, things aren't
going very well at home.

39
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240


40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,240
And it doesn't help much here either.

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,560
That's not true, Zak

42
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,920
You're our Hakuru!

43
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,255
Remember all the battles
we've won. thanks to you.

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,099
For the people of Masara,
Sendokai is the most important thing

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,480
We always settle our
disputes in the field.

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,380
Zet-Sen Shot!

47
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,040
As long as you keep fighting
among yourselves, you'll be easy prey.

48
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,591
You need a leader. Someone
you trust. Someone like Danima

49
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,000
Someone who unites
you to defeat the Yaquis.

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,864
I would be a good leader

51
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,441
You? A rock would be a better leader!

52
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:11,935
Or an energy sphere

53
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:18,240
Sen-Do-Kai!

54
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,716
You Masarians always resolve
your differences with Sendokai, right?

55
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,535
Well, hold a Great Sendokai Tournament.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
And let the winner be your leader.

57
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,495
He's right.

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,435
It's true.

59
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,375
 How did we not think of that before?

60
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,160
I propose that the chiefs of the villages
get together

61
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:49,785
to decide the rules of this tournament.

62
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,600
I don't like this.

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Maybe the tournament
wasn't such a good idea.

64
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,280
Of course it was.

65
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,840
If I hadn't intervened, this
would have ended very badly.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Inhabitants of Mazar.

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
The village leaders.

68
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
We have laid down the following rules.

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:40,087
Anyone may participate in the great tournament
of Sendokai whether born in Masada or not

70
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,360
As long as there is a period of
mourning, No one will be allowed to fight.

71
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,668
At the request of the
Kronians any warrior may

72
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:55,200
be replaced by a
representative of his choice.

73
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,520
And finally, and most importantly

74
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,975
Whoever wins the tournament

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
W be recognized by all the people

76
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
as the new leader of Masara

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,954
Very well.

78
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,907
And with that, let the first Great
Sendokai Tournament begin!

79
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,235
Now

80
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:37,284
Who will participate in
The Great Tournament.

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,540
We, the Norkingos, will participate!

82
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:41,977
And the Deades

83
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,576
And the Drubers!

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,243
And the-

85
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Quickly!

86
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,782
Let's go for it!

87
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,790
Goa-Sen Shield!

88
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,649
Zet-Sen....

89
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,016
But who?

90
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,400
That was close.

91
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,423
These guys are very dangerous.

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,587
Sidmodius!

93
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:48,024
Please!

94
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
What are you doing?

95
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,680
It's Sidmodius! Theo ne
responsible for the attacks!

96
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,800
Don't be silly.
He just saved us.

97
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,454
Thank you very much

98
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,135
You must have me confused with someone else.

99
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,970
I'm Baron Raknaki!

100
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:23,259
I'm also entering the big tournament.

101
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,720
So be it.

102
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,126
Damn you.

103
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,520
It was a great idea to
organize a Great Tournament.

104
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:37,313
Thank you very much, Zak

105
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,800
By the mustache of the queen of hair, where am I?

106
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
I don't remember anything.

107
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,415
The one who was missing. You're
just in time for the great tournament.

108
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
 A tournament?

109
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Someone needs an announcer!

110
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,909
Tanpo!

111
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:22,678
Guys, we have some bad news.

112
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,015
We've been traveling back in time?

113
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,255
The history teacher is going to freak out
when I tell him what it's like.

114
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,775
Now we have to figure out how
Sidmodius plans to turn into the Great Zorn

115
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm afraid we already know.

116
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,407
We've just announced
a Great Sendokai tournament

117
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,576
What?

118
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,640
All he has to do to
get power is to win

119
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
It's the worst thing that could happen.

120
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,554
Thank you very much, Zak

121
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,080
Then there's only one solution.

122
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,116
You'll have to win the first Great
Sendokai tournament in history

123
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll sign us up.

124
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,840
Poor Zak

125
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
¿Qué ocurre?

126
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,800
First, he failed as Hakuru

127
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,720
Then he let Sidmodius get away

128
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
Things aren't much
better at home either.

129
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
And now he's the one who's caused
the great tournament.

130
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,878
By the way, registration is not done here

131
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Where's his bike?

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,683
There's a note!

133
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,335
Dear friends, it's all my fault.

134
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
You deserve a better Hakuru

135
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,761
That's why I've decided to leave the team

136
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:12,135
and not come home.

137
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,063
I'll never forget you.

138
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,506
Zak
