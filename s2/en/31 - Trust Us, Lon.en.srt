1
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,533
Dad, I'll come home late tonight.

2
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,567
Do you have a piano lesson?

3
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,233
I stopped playing 5 years ago!

4
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,233
Uh-huh.

5
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll meet some kids from school.

6
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,633
They're not bad! They're... good!

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I understood.

8
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,433
Lon, I'll give you a piece of advice.

9
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,300
It's a good thing to meet new people, But dont trust them!

10
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:16,733
Nobody will give you something unless they know there is something in return.

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Not even friends!

12
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,920
That seems horrible: when you don't trust other people..

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
That's what made me what I am today.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,500
Are you okay? You look sad..

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,100
We met up in the morning to play soccer.

16
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,133
You should've come!

17
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:50,217
Me helping you fight Sed Modius doesn't mean i'm your friend!

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,130
Okay then, whatever you want.

19
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,933
Sen-do-kai!

20
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:15,275
Everything is connected in the land of Massarah.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Each drop of water.. each plant..

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,780
...Each living creature.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
And I too, am connected to this planet.

24
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,867
I can feel its energy.

25
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,000
But I can also feel... its suffering.

26
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,947
Each time Sed Modius turns a creature into a Yaki

27
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:56,433
These Yaki creature that you've seen before, don't compare to what's about to come next

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
C'mon bring them to me!

29
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,933
They don't scare me!

30
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:18,167
The more energy Sed Modius steals from them, The more energy you have to give them before they can turn back to their true form.

31
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,800
And where do we get this energy?

32
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,067
No one from the warriors can get it.

33
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:31,733
But two can, if they unite and use this power.

34
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:43,633
Woah!

35
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,100
Egnis warriors' sets.

36
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,533
They are yours.

37
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,667
Sen-do-kai!

38
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:42,033
Wait, there are walkie talkies in these sets!

39
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,233
Test. Hello. Hello!

40
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,733
Zak and Lon, come here.

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Both of you put your wristband infront of the other's chest!

42
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,867
Can you both feel eachother's energy?

43
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,233
Yes!

44
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,633
But don't trust them!

45
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,300
Good. and now, you have to try using the power of duo-sen.

46
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,360
Power of duo-sen!
Power of duo-sen!

47
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
But don't trust them

48
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Do not worry.

49
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:07,133
You have both have to work on understanding eachother more.

50
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,433
When you both understand eachother, you will get more energy.

51
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:19,787
It's time for Sendokai!

52
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:30,867
You will spar against eachother.

53
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,633
Yeah!

54
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,267
Yeah!

55
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:49,367
Then let us begin. Sendokai!

56
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:56,767
C'mon!

57
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Kido the warrior, never loses!

58
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Wa-sen shield!

59
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,567
sorry..

60
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,133
Fenzy!

61
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,833
Lon, let's use the power of duo-sen! C'mon!

62
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,033
noe-sen vision!

63
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:39,633
kiet!

64
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Kai.

65
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,033
Yeah!

66
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,167
No!

67
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:58,433
ugh! if you had trusted me a little, that wouldn't have happened!

68
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Kiet!

69
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,247
I don't trust anybody!

70
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,033
That seems horrible: when you don't trust other people..

71
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,467
Kido!

72
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,300
Zet-sen shot!

73
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,600
Tai-sen Trail!

74
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,827
This won't work...

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,680
What a hakuro you are!

76
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:59,173
Let's use sen-rok!

77
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:13,133
It's yours Kido!

78
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,967
Let's use this power!

79
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,557
Power of duo-sen!
Power of duo-sen!

80
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Kai!

81
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah!

82
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,556
Yeah! unleash more energy together! you scored a goal!

83
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,233
Yeah! Yeah!

84
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,433
Good match!

85
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,600
Yeah, good job!

86
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Thanks!

87
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,133
Danima!

88
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,033
What's wrong?!

89
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:53,833
Sed Modius... He attacked a village and turned all of its residents into Yakis.

90
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,967
We have to turn Yakis back to normal!

91
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,800
We'll go and find those Yakis, and we will free them!

92
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:09,467
Uh Danima, What's the village that Sed Modius attacked?!

93
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:14,767
Your home village... Kiwuns!

94
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:26,733
Come to me my babies!

95
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,213
I never get defeated!
