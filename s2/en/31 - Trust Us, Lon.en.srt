1
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,212
Dad, I'll come home late tonight.

2
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:49,892
Do you have a piano lesson?

3
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,233
I stopped playing 5 years ago!

4
00:00:57,611 --> 00:00:59,208
I met some kids at school!

5
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,275
They're not bad! They're... good!

6
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:04,942
Listen

7
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:08,475
Lon, I'll give you a piece of advice.

8
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,708
It's a good thing to meet new
people, But don't trust them!

9
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:17,375
Nobody will give you anything, unless
they know there is something in return.

10
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:19,169
Not even friends!

11
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,920
That seems horrible: when
you don't trust other people..

12
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,033
That's what made me what I am today.

13
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,500
Are you okay? You look sad.

14
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,100
We met up in the morning to play soccer.

15
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:45,618
You should've come!

16
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:50,641
Me helping you fight Sidmodius
doesn't make me your friend!

17
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,743
Okay then, whatever you want.

18
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,902
Sen-do-kai!

19
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:15,884
Everything is connected
in the land of Masara

20
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:20,634
Each drop of water.. each plant..

21
00:02:22,297 --> 00:02:24,579
...Each living creature.

22
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,242
And I too, am connected to this planet.

23
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:36,540
I can feel its energy.

24
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,961
But I can also feel... its suffering.

25
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:46,650
Each time Sidmodius
turns a creature into a Yaki

26
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:56,675
These Yaki creature that you've seen before,
don't compare to what's about to come next

27
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,527
C'mon bring them to me!

28
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,314
They don't scare me!

29
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:13,014
The more energy Sidmodius steals
from them, The more energy you

30
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:18,984
have to give them before they
can turn back to their true form.

31
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,868
And where do we get this energy?

32
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,949
No one from the
warriors can get it.

33
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:32,091
But two can, if they
unite and use this power.

34
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:48,243
Ignis Armor

35
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,587
They are yours.

36
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,541
Sen-do-kai!

37
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:42,622
Wait, there are walkie
talkies in these sets!

38
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,920
Test. Hello. Hello!

39
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,834
Zak and Lon, come here.

40
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,600
Both of you put your wristband
infront of the other's chest!

41
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,734
Can you both feel
eachother's energy?

42
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,508
Yes!

43
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,585
<i>But don't trust them!</i>

44
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:17,998
Yes

45
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:33,026
Good. Now, you have to try
activating the Duo-Sen Force

46
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,227
<i>Duo-Sen Force!</i>

47
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
<i>But don't trust them</i>

48
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:03,856
Do not worry.

49
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:08,161
You have both have to work on
understanding eachother more.

50
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:14,315
When you both understand
eachother, you will get more energy.

51
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,713
It's time for Sendokai!

52
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:31,608
You will spar against eachother.

53
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,633
Yeah!

54
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,267
Yeah!

55
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:49,431
Let the Sendokai begin!

56
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,990
Kido the warrior, never loses!

57
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,362
Goa-Sen Shield!

58
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,308
Sorry!

59
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,133
Fenzy!

60
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,833
Lon, let's use the Duo-Sen Force!

61
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Nu-Sen Flare!

62
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,136
Kiet!

63
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:51,722
Kai.

64
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:53,142
Yeah!

65
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,167
No!

66
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,889
If you had trusted me a little,
that wouldn't have happened!

67
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Kiet!

68
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:25,693
Lon. We don't have to be
friends if you don't want to.

69
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,504
But you have to trust us.

70
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,108
I can't trust anyone.

71
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,053
It must be horrible to
be afraid of everyone

72
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,219
Kido!

73
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:47,519
Zet-sen shot!

74
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:57,962
Tai-sen Trail!

75
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,993
This is useless

76
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:07,698
What a hakuro you are!

77
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,757
There's a Senrok waiting for us!

78
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:26,387
It's yours Kido!

79
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,071
Let's activate this power!

80
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,134
Duo-Sen Force!

81
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,850
Kai!

82
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,556
Yeah!

83
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,159
Wow, how strong

84
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:21,840
They had so much energy
that a single kai was enough!

85
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,139
Good game, guys!

86
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,130
Yeah, good job!

87
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Thanks!

88
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,335
Danima!

89
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,199
What's wrong?!

90
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:05,726
Sidmodius... He attacked a village
and turned all of its residents into Yakis.

91
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,228
We have to turn Yakis back to normal!

92
00:11:11,746 --> 00:11:14,041
Oh no... Sorceress...

93
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:14,711
What?

94
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:23,628
We will find those Yaqis
and we will free them!

95
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,784
Danima, which village did Sidmodius attack?

96
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,691
The Kiwun Village

97
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:33,762
Your home...

98
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,812
Come to me, my creatures

99
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:50,375
They are invincible!
