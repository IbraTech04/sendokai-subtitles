1
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:42,440
Ahh! Nothing like a
hearty supper with friends!

2
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,525
You know what would go down a treat now?

3
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,163
A little nip of quondam juice!

4
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:49,370
none left

5
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,005
Zhu Li mistook it for a bottle of water

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,067
and dragged a lot

7
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:59,168
Teenage passion when you hold me tight!

8
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:04,268
Teenage passion! [mumbled speech]

9
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,869
Looks like it's gone straight to her head

10
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,925
So what do we do?

11
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,051
We could tell stories!

12
00:01:13,076 --> 00:01:14,695
Good idea!

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,195
Who! do you want to start the ball rolling?

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,020
Bowling?

15
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,445
Do I want to go bowling?

16
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,470
Oh, nevermind

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,190
Grum why don't you tell us the tale of

18
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,220
the Sendokai Warriors who saved the

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,258
multiverse!

20
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:34,419
Why not?

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,580
It all began many moons ago

22
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:44,120
The Zorn empire was
conquering the multiverse

23
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:49,248
And drawing ever closer
to a planet named Earth

24
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,878
Which was home to four youngsters

25
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:56,237
Chloe, Kiet, Fenzy, and Zack

26
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:09,875
They were what you call <i>popular</i>

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,639
<i>Go on! Get lost!</i>

28
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,396
But one day something
happened that would change

29
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,110
their lives forever

30
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,675
<i>Sendokayetus!</i>

31
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,760
Tampo, the Wadan, accepted them as

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,250
his Senkuns and sent out to turn them

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,762
into Sendokai warriors

34
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,966
To save their planet from the Zorn invasion

35
00:02:37,353 --> 00:02:38,100
They would have to win

36
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,120
The Great Sendokai Tornament

37
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,013
And so, their training began

38
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,755
In the urlock dimension

39
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,388
Where they helped the inhabitants
fight off giant cockroaches

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,940
Hooray!

41
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,130
In return, The Urlocks gave them their

42
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,200
first suits of armor

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Sen-Do-Kai!

44
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:16,319
Tampo continued working
them hard to improve their abilities

45
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:25,049
Sometimes, Tampo organised combats

46
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,690
against other Sendokai warriors

47
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,664
To put his Senkun's skills to the test

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,105
They even had to compete against

49
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,588
The guardian of Nustrad's chest as they

50
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:38,613
Oh yes!

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Good pooch!

52
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,984
As trained and learned
to control the sen energy

53
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,840
They traveled to new dimension and

54
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:50,990
made new friends!

55
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,889
Chloe helped the Maoons and their fight against the

56
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,680
hidden ones

57
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,538
And discovered her Yao-Sen vision

58
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,642
Kiet liberated the Morlocks dimension

59
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:15,070
and activated his Coa-Sen Shield

60
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:21,451
Fenzy fought alongside the beldzars

61
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,050
That was the first time she used the

62
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,839
Tai-Sen trail

63
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,239
Gotcha!

64
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:36,385
And Zach defended the Kaijuns
from the Senadompt attack

65
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,822
He finally mastered the Zet-Sen shot

66
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,946
That boy has something special about him

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,005
Although he couldn't beat me
<i>laughs</i>

68
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,740
Sure, and the fact he
slipped on your glass-eye had

69
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,752
nothing to do with it, right?

70
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,566
A- minor detail

71
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,560
As I was saying, they
liberated many dimensions!

72
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:17,792
But the night before the tournament,
Tampo revealed a secret

73
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:22,383
He told them- I'm a bearded woman!

74
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:26,377
No! That's not what he said!

75
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:30,870
He didn't? I must've gotten
it mixed up with another story

76
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,569
The "bearded-woman" business was something

77
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:36,090
that happened to me it was a little

78
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,280
embarrassing

79
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,138
what did tempo tell

80
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,699
Them that he had competed
in the great tournament 10,000

81
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,360
years earlier! And lost! and so condemned

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,615
his people to slavery

83
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:54,935
At last, the day

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,419
of the tournament dawned and the

85
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,930
youngsters fought like real warriors

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,305
Tai-Sen Trail!

87
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:18,675
They faced opponents of all shapes and sizes

88
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:22,161
each stronger
than the one before

89
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,729
Each more dangerous

90
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,217
but the Senkuns had new armor

91
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:32,698
And new powers

92
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,837
Zack had activated the Sho-Sen Fire

93
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:42,399
Chloe the Nu-Sen Flare

94
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:47,010
Young Fenzy could unleash the

95
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,435
Go-Sen Tornado

96
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,996
And Kiet, the Geo-Sen Shockwave

97
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,509
all these different attacks are making

98
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:01,525
my head spin

99
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,419
as the tournament progressed the story

100
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,849
took a new turn

101
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:12,553
Lallith, we'll always be together the

102
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:15,752
Lallith was my girlfriend

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,805
And, well Tampo

104
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,349
and Lallith were not the only ones who

105
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,336
felt a special feeling

106
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:31,950
Blow it and make a wish!

107
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,521
Aww, how sweet

108
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,770
But the toughest part was still yet to come!

109
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,180
They still have to face the

110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,715
Zorn commanders!

111
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,994
First they fall against Cascrad's
Team, who turned out to be

112
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,860
Dark versions of themselves

113
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,750
The humans won, and defeated their own

114
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,881
dark side!

115
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:19,558
Next, they faced commander Lallith and her team of specters

116
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,900
Lallith was about to
defeat the youngsters

117
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:34,729
But at the very last minute

118
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,747
something unexpected happened

119
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:43,490
the commander let herself be beaten so

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,250
So that tanpo and the Senkuns could

121
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,914
defeat the Zorn

122
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,970
Treason!

123
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,514
To punish her betrayal,

124
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,521
The Marshal condemned Lallith to the vortex

125
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,765
But Tanpo stepped in to
save her!

126
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,427
And at that moment

127
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,064
He revealed before the whole world

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,619
The marshal's real identity

129
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:24,195
Kento is the one who was
once my brother

130
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:27,514
That I was not expecting

131
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:37,310
In the end, Tampo sacrificed himself to

132
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,410
protect the woman he had always loved

133
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,773
The youngsters were on their own

134
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,360
The last Sendokai would take place on

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,444
earth as the invasion began

136
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,139
But those young warriors weren't gonna

137
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,266
stand by and let it happen that

138
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:11,459
Lallith joined them and together they made a

139
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,077
plan to defeat the Zorn

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
The final of the tournament arrived and

141
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,305
things looked bleak

142
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:24,993
The Zorn were too strong

143
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,842
<i>only a miracle can save us</i>

144
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:28,413
But then

145
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:35,272
Tanpo returned from the vortex

146
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:37,132
Bringing reinforcements

147
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,431
Tt seemed there was still hope

148
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,797
<i>Sho-Sen Fire!</i>

149
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,155
Until the marshal played his final card

150
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:13,380
The marshal transformed the Senkuns

151
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:14,833
into normal children

152
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:16,786
<i>No!</i>

153
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,537
And their wristband stopped working

154
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:25,832
<i>I once told you: to be
a Sendokai warrior...</i>

155
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,923
<i>Is much more than wearing a wrist band</i>

156
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,406
Forward, Senkuns!

157
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,405
<i>Yours, Fenzi!</i>

158
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,470
The youngster summoned
up their coverage and

159
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,798
faced the Marshal

160
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,770
And in that very moment, Zack remembered

161
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,140
his real motivation

162
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:30,871
And that was how a bunch of kids from

163
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:34,422
Earth saved their planet

164
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,521
And the rest of the Multiverse!

165
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:42,240
Aw, happy endings always make me cry

166
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:44,304
Poke your eye?

167
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,280
I did not poke your eye!

168
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,176
...not this time

169
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:52,190
But, did Sid Modi's managed to escape?

170
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Yes

171
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:57,964
At the last moment he grabs a strands chest

172
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:01,020
and things got even more complicated!

173
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,380
But that's another story

174
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,273
What?! You can't leave us hanging

175
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,895
What about Zack and Chloe!?

176
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,420
Did they own up to their feelings?

177
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,786
What about Tanpo and Lallith?

178
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,639
What happened to them?!

179
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,444
And Kento? What happened to Kento?

180
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,536
You can't end the story like that!

181
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:26,467
We need to know more!

182
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:27,838
Calm down!

183
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,373
The story doesn't end here

184
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:36,047
But it's late. You'll find
out what happened next

185
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:37,734
very soon
