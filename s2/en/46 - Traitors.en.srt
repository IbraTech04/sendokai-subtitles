1
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,840
Both teams are very even!

2
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,775
May I?

3
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,432
Only if you promise not to complain

4
00:01:19,457 --> 00:01:21,100
And why would I?

5
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,040
You always complain when your team loses

6
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,700
Kido, Yours

7
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,828
That boy is not clean wheat

8
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:39,726
You are right, Something is not going well

9
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,500
And it could even get worse

10
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:44,113
Chronan Sun!

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,100
Enjoy the show

12
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,156
I'm going to start the
final phase of our plan

13
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:07,282
Guys! Avoid his attacks like
we did with The Norkingos!

14
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:08,660
We are more agile

15
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,660
We will not let ourselves
be defeated by some lizards!

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,065
What did you just call us?

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,393
Calm down, guys. Remember
what happened with the Kredlers.

18
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:45,280
We have to focus on the combat
and not get carried away by emotions

19
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,920
The Kiwun team is getting
dangerously close to the Human Senrok

20
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,080
But what are you doing?  Stop them!

21
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:11,951
Zet-sen...

22
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,319
Tai-sen trail!

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
...Shot!

24
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,160
Kai From the Kiwuns

25
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Yay!

26
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
Damn

27
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,280
Yupiii

28
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,720
Yupi?

29
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:39,740
Leave me alone

30
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,660
We have to activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

31
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,900
But we haven't found a common goal

32
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,431
I'll Give You One. We Have to Hate Zack!

33
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,064
What?!

34
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:57,660
What do the 4 of us have in
common? That Zack betrayed us!

35
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,280
That's what unites us

36
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,920
Uncle, I don't see it

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,018
You're right Lon, I don't think it's...

38
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:10,200
Enough, it's not time to
argue, but to obey your Hakuru

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,920
It seems that the Human team
is preparing to Counterattack!

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,315
Nero-Sen fusion

41
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,915
They're going to activate
the Nero-sen fusion!

42
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,800
Us too! Quick, let's think of a common goal

43
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,247
I have it! Gargling with Mucus

44
00:04:35,272 --> 00:04:36,388
Yes!!

45
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,920
Are you sure that...

46
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Very well, let's try it!

47
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,580
Everything is going according to my plans

48
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,800
Spirits without Sensation, The time
has come to fulfill your true mission

49
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,100
You will come with me And we will return
the Multi-verse To the abysses of darkness

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,120
I don't know what you intend to do...

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,780
Sister...

52
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,720
...But I'm not going to
let you get away with it.

53
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,326
Nero-sen fusion

54
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,360
How could it fail? What's
more cool than gargling mucus?

55
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,034
By the Buttocks of King Trog!

56
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,573
Both teams have tried to unleash a
great power, and they have failed Let's

57
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,347
Try again

58
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:26,888
No!

59
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:32,920
We will never feel hate for
Zack, because he is our friend

60
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,880
You will feel what I tell you

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,293
Do you prefer a traitor to your own Hakuru?

62
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,380
Well, I'll win the fight ALONE.

63
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,311
Tai-sen trail

64
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,020
I don't understand. It looks like a
human is going to face The Kiwuns alone.

65
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,115
Eh, but how did he do that?

66
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,880
He acquired our powers while
we were doing the Nero-sen fusion

67
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:17,650
Geo-sen shockwave!

68
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,391
Yao-sen vision!

69
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,132
Zet-sen shot!

70
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,340
Kai for the Human team!
Or at least... one Human

71
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,268
You have started a war that you cannot win

72
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:11,933
The truth is on our side, We will defeat
Sidmodius

73
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,720
And we will erase Evil from the multiverse

74
00:08:15,901 --> 00:08:21,261
Sidmodius... Do you still
think Sidmodius is the key?

75
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,380
Where is your smile now?

76
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,460
Enough

77
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,893
This is not Sendokai. We are
not going to let you fight like this

78
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,200
Give us the Do

79
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,900
Traitors!

80
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,153
I can't trust anyone!

81
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,340
Lon, give us the Do

82
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,740
No!

83
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:55,753
Geo-sen shockwave!

84
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,711
Goa-Sen shield

85
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,280
Wow! The Human Just
Immobilized His Own Team!

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Oh No, He's Lost His Reason

87
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,620
Lon, Stop!

88
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:39,065
You are like my father! Like my
mother! And you, Chloe!

89
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:45,160
You are the worst. You made me believe that
you cared! That I was not alone!

90
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,243
You are not alone, Lon

91
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,767
Lies! Always Lies!

92
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,753
I don't need you! I don't need anyone!

93
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,859
Sidmodius Is a Simple Piece.

94
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,060
There Are Others Who Fight For
Me And They Don't Even Know It

95
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:28,440
Because Evil Dwells In All Beings

96
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,028
As long as there is someone who suffers,
someone hurt, someone alone.

97
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:42,140
I will make the Flame of Hate
grow. And I will turn him into My deer

98
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,239
That's why it's impossible to defeat me

99
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:53,150
And that's why, Sister, Evil will reign again!
