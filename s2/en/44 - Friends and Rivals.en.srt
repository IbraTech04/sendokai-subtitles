1
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,213
Guys! To activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

2
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,253
We must find a common goal

3
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,222
But what can the Kiwuns
and I have in common?

4
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,482
I got it, the burps.

5
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,733
Are you sure about that?

6
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,015
Everyone likes burps!

7
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:55,241
Alright, we can try it

8
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,671
Nero-Sen Fusion

9
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:25,509
It's going to be hard to master the fusion.

10
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,013
Don't worry, we still have a secret weapon!

11
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,506
The Kido-Sen Attack!

12
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,741
What the heck?!

13
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,192
Too bad we're not in a spitting tournament

14
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,509
We would surely win

15
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,142
Do you really intend on
activating the Nero-Sen Fusion?

16
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,781
Only the masters of fire have achieved it

17
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,094
And you are nothing more than...

18
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,009
Slimy peasants

19
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:09,020
We are not peasants, nor are we slimey-

20
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,908
We are not peasants!

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Whatever you say....

22
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:25,009
Those Credlers have been treating
us like bumpkins for centuries.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,398
Oops.. Sorry

24
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:31,673
I'll be right back

25
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,595
Hey, Chloe!

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,547
Zack!

27
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:44,935
How's it going?

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,615
You've got a match coming up, no?

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,813
Yeah

30
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,424
I hope I'm not late

31
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,643
Don't worry. You've never been late, Zack

32
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,182
Zack!

33
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,275
Ready for the fight.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Always

35
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,344
If you win, we'll face
each other in the next one.

36
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,453
Yes, I suppose so

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,573
Attention, please! Team Credler
and team Kiwun, come to the field!

38
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,471
They're calling me. See
you in the next match!

39
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,887
I hope they do well.

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,135
Well, I don't.

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,459
Anyone who's not on our team is our rival,
and it's best not to hang out with rivals.

42
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:38,359
In today's match, Team Kiwun
and Team Credler will face off!

43
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,709
is their oven that flies, these

44
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:05,740
peasants say, like you,

45
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,060
to hell with the chickens

46
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,279
boys

47
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,420
those grown-ups are the best only

48
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,640
because they are smarter, richer, more

49
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,210
beautiful and stronger but we are

50
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,050
more

51
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,410
no,

52
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,140
those fools are full of resentment or they are

53
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,020
not going to achieve anything  they cannot

54
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:16,259
lohan to release a joint power

55
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,390
according to todd stern [

56
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,459
Applause]

57
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,070
come on our difficult is like a field

58
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,250
of yours but without vegetables

59
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,240
do not let the emotions  dominate us,

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,130
control our anger and you will have

61
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,480
control of the fight,

62
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,720
guys, don't waste your energy

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
hating them, ferrat their mouths and respond to

64
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,419
their insults with your feet by kicking I don't

65
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,449
allow that

66
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,710
1

67
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,940
no

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,820
about putting on those insect eaters,

69
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,000
our comments don't seem to affect them, there

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,070
's no point in enjoying those who don't get

71
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,250
offended, we'll do the same thing that they keep silent about,

72
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,310
and in fighting

73
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,830
the teams have totally changed

74
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,480
for now on the list,

75
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,039
let's do it  the sweet door

76
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,840
then I

77
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,790
have to protect it

78
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,430
when the level or the pure

79
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,630
I take care of it

80
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,149
Music] they

81
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,260
are too strong to remain more

82
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,830
secret [

83
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,870
and

84
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,700
have come to congratulate you

85
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,760
and to thank you. It has been many

86
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
centuries since we have enjoyed the holy chalice so much

87
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,210
after what you did to us in the

88
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,330
past because one day

89
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:02,150
they came and said that as  You guys who

90
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,750
did

91
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,110
something, we've been watching the ones

92
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,360
that arrive for so long and we remember the reason,

93
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,400
it's true,

94
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,190
oh,

95
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,450
and better

96
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,490

make us become friends with the bears 0 2 [

98
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:34,920
congratulations, you won thanks to the fact that it's

99
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,699
good for your parents, yes, no.  Let's be in

100
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,720
a spitting tournament

101
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,990
hey, I was thinking, we have

102
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,630
an afternoon at the movies pending,

103
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,280
Chloe, there's a lot at stake in this tournament,

104
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,870
we can't let our emotions

105
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,590
dominate us, and it seems like things

106
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,180
are going well for you with the con,

107
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,390
no, I don't even think so.  It would be better if we do

108
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,820
n't talk again until all this is

109
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,970
over

110
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,310
I guess you're right from

111
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,810
now on we are rivals

112
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,040
friends rivals

113
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,079
