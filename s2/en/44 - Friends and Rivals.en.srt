Guys! To activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

2
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,253
We must find a common goal

3
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,222
But what can the Kiwuns
and I have in common?

4
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,482
I got it, the burps.

5
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,733
Are you sure about that?

00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,015

00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:25,509
It's going to be hard to master the fusion.

10
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,013
Don't worry, we still have a secret weapon!

11
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,506
The Kido-Sen Attack!

12
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,741
What the heck?!

13
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,192
Too bad we're not in a spitting tournament

14
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,509
We would surely win

15
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,142
Do you really intend on
activating the Nero-Sen Fusion?

16
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,781
Only the masters of fire have achieved it

17
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,094
And you are nothing more than...

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,009
Slimy peasants

19
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:09,020
We are not peasants, nor are we slimey-
