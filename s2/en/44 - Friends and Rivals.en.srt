1
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,213
Guys! To activate the Nero-Sen Fusion

2
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,253
We must find a common goal

3
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:44,222
But what can the Kiwuns
and I have in common?

4
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:46,482
I got it, the burps.

5
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:48,733
Are you sure about that?

6
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,015
Everyone likes burps!

7
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:55,241
Alright, we can try it

8
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:08,671
Nero-Sen Fusion

9
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:25,509
It's going to be hard to master the fusion.

10
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,013
Don't worry, we still have a secret weapon!

11
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,506
The Kido-Sen Attack!

12
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:37,741
What the heck?!

13
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,192
Too bad we're not in a spitting tournament

14
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:50,509
We would surely win

15
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,142
Do you really intend on
activating the Nero-Sen Fusion?

16
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:00,781
Only the masters of fire have achieved it

17
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,094
And you are nothing more than...

18
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,009
Slimy peasants

19
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:09,020
We are not peasants, nor are we slimy-

20
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:12,908
We are not peasants!

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Whatever you say....

22
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:25,009
Those Credlers have been treating
us like bumpkins for centuries.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,398
Oops.. Sorry

24
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:31,673
I'll be right back

25
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:42,595
Hey, Cloe!

26
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,547
Zak!

27
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:44,935
How's it going?

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,615
You've got a match coming up, no?

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,813
Yeah

30
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,424
I hope I'm not late

31
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,643
Don't worry. You've never been late, Zak

32
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,182
Zak!

33
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,275
Ready for the fight.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Always

35
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:04,344
If you win, we'll face
each other in the next one.

36
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,453
Yes, I suppose so

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,573
Attention, please! Team Credler
and team Kiwun, come to the field!

38
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,471
They're calling me. See
you in the next match!

39
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,887
I hope they do well.

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,135
Well, I don't.

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,459
Anyone who's not on our team is our rival,
and it's best not to hang out with rivals.

42
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:38,359
In today's match, Team Kiwun
and Team Credler will face off!

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,412
Is that the smell of sweat?

44
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:01,923
Yes, from these peasants.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,715
Well, I smell something coming from you!

46
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,106
The punch we're going to give you!

47
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:18,594
Oh no!

48
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:19,680
Guys!

49
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:21,225
Focus on the match!

50
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,180
Cred-Sen Lash!

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,593
Kai for the Credlers!

52
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
Come on, Kiwuns!

53
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,185
Those Credlers think
they're better just because

54
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,644
they're smarter, richer,
better looking, and stronger

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,365
Yeah! But weâ€™re, uhh

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,423
Greener!

57
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:04,926
Those fools are full of resentment.

58
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:06,488
They won't get anywhere like that

59
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:10,126
The Kiwuns can't snatch
the Do from the Credlers!

60
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:14,625
They're going to unleash a joint power!

61
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,551
Duo-Sen Force!

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
No!

63
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,689
Second Kai of the Credlers!

64
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,866
They have opened the Senrok!

65
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:37,348
Come on, it's not hard!

66
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:41,042
It's like one of your fields,
but without vegetables

67
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,430
Zak!

68
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,522
Do not let emotions dominate you

69
00:05:49,547 --> 00:05:53,944
Control your anger and you
will have control of the fight

70
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,080
Guys! Don't waste your energy hating them

71
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:04,212
Shut up and respond to
their insults with your feet

72
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,522
By kicking?

73
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:08,145
No! With Sendokai!

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,471
Look, a feisty lizard!

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,245
And you're-

76
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,270
Kido!

77
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:40,223
Kai for The Kiwuns!

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Yeah!

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,020
Incredible!

80
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,830
The Kiwuns have managed to recover!

81
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,975
Those insect eaters seem
unaffected by our comments

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,385
It doesn't make sense to insult
those who are not offended.

83
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,756
Let's do the same as
them, shut up and fight.

84
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:14,086
Wow! The style of both
teams has completely changed!

85
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,480
Now the fight is even!

86
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,374
Kido! Let's use the Duo-Sen Force!

87
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,753
Duo-Sen Force!

88
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,915
Yay!

89
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,627
It's tied!

90
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:01,840
Sho-Sen Fire!

91
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
Protect the Senrok!

92
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,732
They're going to activate the wall!

93
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,949
I'll take care of it

94
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,019
Duo-Sen Wall!

95
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,277
They're too strong!

96
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:43,116
Ah! The secret weapon!

97
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,754
The Kiwuns are up to something

98
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,147
One of them is heading
towards the Credlers!

99
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,267
It looks like he's going to....

100
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,029
Kido-Sen Spit Attack!

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,281
Kai for the Kiwuns!

102
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,173
And with that, The Kiwuns take the victory!

103
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,574
We have come to congratulate you

104
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,020
And to thank you

105
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:46,966
It has been many centuries since
we have enjoyed Sendokai so much

106
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,426
How dare you?

107
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,146
After what you did to us in the past?

108
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,773
What did they do to you?

109
00:09:52,798 --> 00:09:55,585
Well, one day they came and said....

110
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,610
No, wait.

111
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,666
They made...

112
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,423
No

113
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,693
What was it?

114
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:03,509
Was it you who did....

115
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:04,845
I don't know

116
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,765
Something!

117
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:10,613
We've been hating each other for so long
that we don't even remember the reason

118
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,832
it's true,

119
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:27,916
Look what you've achieved,
making us friends with those snobs!

120
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
Zak!

121
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,471
Congratulations! You won!

122
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,585
Thanks to Kido

123
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,700
Well, to his parents

124
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:41,274
Yeah, too bad we're not
in a spitting tournament

125
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:53,817
Hey, I was thinking

126
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:57,630
We have an afternoon at the movies pending,

127
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,923
Cloe, there's a lot at
stake in this tournament,

128
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:04,706
we can't let our emotions dominate us

129
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,895
Besides, it seems like things
are going well for you and Lon

130
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
With Lon?

131
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:13,181
Zak! Lon and I don't-

132
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:18,444
I think it's best if we don't
talk again until all this is over

133
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,697
I guess you're right from

134
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:25,227
From now on, we are rivals

135
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,178
Friendly rivals

136
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,367
Friendly rivals
