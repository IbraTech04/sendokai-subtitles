1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Zack!

2
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,820
What a joy it is to see you!

3
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,469
You gave us quite the scare, buddy!

4
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:53,144
You look more painted than
when my mother has a date

5
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:56,563
You look... changed

6
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,600
That's because I have changed

7
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:05,731
I'm glad you're back, but
the team is already signed up

8
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:09,243
I'm afraid you won't
be able to fight with us

9
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,505
I know

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
But I'll fight with the Kiwuns

11
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:35,566
Look who's here

12
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,191
Start packing your suitcases, Kiwuns

13
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:42,165
When we win the fight you will go home

14
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,059
Yeah! And when we win the
tournament you will go to another planet

15
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,367
Damn Norkingos! We're going to-

16
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,595
<i>Unintelligable speech by Keenan, with the Do still stuck in his mouth</i>

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,741
Well said, brother

18
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,906
In this fight, the Norkingos and
the Kiwuns will face each other!

19
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,158
I'm going to talk to Zack

20
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,674
That boy needs to hear
a voice with experience

21
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,742
Kento, the enemy of advice will have a

22
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,066
Will he have a disciple

23
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,701
I am not an enemy of advice

24
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:35,757
It's just that yours are very bad

25
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:38,892
Let's see which team defeats Sidmodius

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,901
Let the Sendokai begin!

27
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:05,896
Mine!

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,123
Let's go Kiwuns!

29
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:12,222
The Kiwuns take the lead

30
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,505
Kido! Don't Stop!

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
Stand up to him!

32
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,090
The Kiwuns have nothing
against the Norkingo fury!

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,986
Hey!

34
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,575
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,882
Yes! Uh..

36
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,197
Or two half your size!

37
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,390
Keenan! Keeway!

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,883
Let's show them what we've got!

39
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,030
Oh no!

40
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,179
The Kiwuns are not made for melee

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,420
No-Sen Hammer!

42
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,876
Kai for the Norkingos!

43
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,496
That Baron Ragnaki is very powerful

44
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,530
I can feel his energy

45
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,528
Can we beat him?

46
00:04:37,553 --> 00:04:38,956
I think so

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,294
But that woman... There
is something <i>evil</i> about her

48
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,660
We need other teams to
be able to stand up to him.

49
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,155
Zack!

50
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,617
The Kiwuns cannot face
others in hand-to-hand combat

51
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:58,210
You have to change your way of thinking

52
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:02,801
A good leader not only knows
his strengths and weaknesses

53
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:05,686
He also knows those of his team

54
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,381
The Kiwuns are not strong,
but they are agile and elusive

55
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:20,735
Hey guys!

56
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,578
Change of strategy

57
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:27,736
Avoid contact! Make
them run and tire them out!

58
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,250
Stop whispering and fight like men!

59
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:37,651
No, not like men! We
will fight like Kiwuns!

60
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,364
Yay!

61
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,955
The Kiwons have reacted!

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,249
Kai for the Kiwuns!

63
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,696
for you

64
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,321
The combat is very even!

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes!

66
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,126
Yeah!

67
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:23,263
This is not going to end like this!

68
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,676
The Norkingos counter attack!

69
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,983
They haven't said the last word yet

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,616
Let's go!

71
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,259
We can't get through it!

72
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
No!

73
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,376
Kai for the Norkingos!

74
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,510
Damn it

75
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:13,623
We won't be able to take
down this shield with just speed

76
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:18,364
Zack! The Kiwuns have
been students of Danima

77
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:21,668
We can also use Duo-Sen powers!

78
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:28,363
Keenan, Keeway. Protect the
Senrock with the Duo-Sen Wall

79
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,370
Kido, you're with me

80
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,255
Haven't you had enough yet?

81
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,053
The Norkingos attack with all their might

82
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,596
This move could be final!

83
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,672
No-Sen Hammer!

84
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,043
Duo-Sen Wall!

85
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,970
Kido! Yours!

86
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,994
No-Sen Shield

87
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,290
Duo-Sen Force!

88
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,319
Incredible!

89
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,596
Double-Kai for the Kiwuns!

90
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,530
Letting them Win the Sendokai

91
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,857
No.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,603
Yeah!

93
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:25,322
This deserves a Conga-Tongue

94
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,031
Congratulations, guys. What a fight!

95
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,061
Thank you

96
00:09:49,086 --> 00:09:50,275
Do you guys realize?

97
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,470
Now we have two teams
that can beat Sidmodius!

98
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,858
But the only way to defeat
Sidmodius is with the Nero-Sen fusion

99
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,436
And only we can only do that

100
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,818
We can kick his ass
just as much as you guys!

101
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:09,671
No, Keenan. He's right

102
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,336
We only have one Nero Armor

103
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,928
That has a solution....

104
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,506
A Nero Rock!

105
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,296
Sendokai!

106
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:48,111
This armor will increase your power

107
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:55,675
Remember that releasing the nero-sen
fusion depends on your rapport as a team

108
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,076
This means you need to find a common goal

109
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:05,043
Something only a good Hakuru can achieve

110
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:13,123
Damn Magmus

111
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:17,476
Now two teams are conspiring to defeat me

112
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:24,063
You don't have to worry. Before they
get to you, they'll have to face each other

113
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,483
And the Kiwuns move on to the next phase!

114
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:32,063
Along with the Kevvers and the Humans!

115
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:43,383
A new and powerful force
will be decisive in this battle....

116
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:45,095
Jealousy.
