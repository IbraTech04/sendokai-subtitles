1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
You've always been
our hakuro, Zack

2
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:49,163
Together, we will
defeat Sidmodius!

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,269
Yes!!

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,700
You see? You
joined me in the end.

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You should be
winning a tournament

6
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,180
Wait!

7
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:29,800
The fury of all those you
have hurt will fall on you today.

8
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,420
The human warriors
have arrived just in time.

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Hah! Suck that one!

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,140
Well, without further delay, let's
start the final of the Grand Tournament.

11
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,740
It's time...

12
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,960
SENDOKAI!!!!

13
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,080
[Crowd Cheering] Ragnaki!
Ragnaki! Ragnaki! Ragnaki!

14
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,260
Masara-Sendo-Kayetsu

15
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,520
Let the Sendokai begin!

16
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:13,920
Baron Ragnaki steps
forward and takes the Do

17
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,460
Not so fast...

18
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,360
Nu-Sen Flare!

19
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,180
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

20
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,760
Go-Sen Tornado!

21
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Hey?

22
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,080
The 2 teams are very even!!!

23
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,660
How about we stop warming
up and start fighting seriously?

24
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,950
Baron Ragnaki has fallen!

25
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,575
It seems as if he
has received a blow

26
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,100
CHEATING Humans!!!

27
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
But he is pretending!!!

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,340
I already know that trick

29
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,860
EH! He escaped!

30
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,620
Kiet! Fenzy! Go for it!!!

31
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,205
Sid-Sen...

32
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,220
Tai-Sen Trail!

33
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,100
Hey?

34
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,670
The Humans get The Do
and prevent a Kai from Baron!

35
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,040
20, 21, and 22, I'm winning

36
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Ha, I've beaten 23...

37
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,620
But the little one doesn't count

38
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,243
Stop behaving like children. You
look like you are 200 years old!!!

39
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll have to make it a little
more difficult for them...

40
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,960
What's happening?

41
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Oh, look!

42
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,650
Oh no!

43
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,957
Where did all those
monsters come from?!?

44
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:15,040
How horrible... And
Zack is out there!

45
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,480
We can't find our children. By
any chance, could they be here?

46
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,860
Oh no... They've
done it again...

47
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,155
Look, I told Kiet not to
save the world anymore!

48
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,280
We have to go out
and fight with them!!!

49
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,580
But if we are nothing
more than human,

50
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,540
I refuse to let a pack of monsters take
over our planet without fighting back!

51
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,820
Careful Tanpo! Behind you!

52
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:22,520
Hi handsome... I thought
you wouldn't come back...

53
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,140
To the attack!

54
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Sid-Sin...

55
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,580
Duo-Sen Wall!

56
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,660
Sho-Sen Fire!

57
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,500
Sid-Sen Shied!

58
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,100
It seems that the Baron is having a
hard time Fighting at the level of Humans

59
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,180
Yoohoo! That's how it's done!

60
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes! High five!

61
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,800
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

62
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,960
Hmmm... When it comes to
Sidmodius, I wouldn't trust too easily

63
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Don't you realize?

64
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:17,135
These people don't care about you at all!

65
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,435
They don't deserve your help,
why do you do it? Why do you fight?

66
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,915
For Masara, for The
Earth, and for Danima...

67
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,283
Ahhhh yes... I'm sorry
about the old lady.

68
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,856
I shouldn't have stolen so much energy from
her when I transformed her into Yaki...

69
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,200
So If he transformed
her... That means that...

70
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Exactly! That I
absorbed her powers!

71
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:08,700
Masara - SEN - FRACTAAA!!!

72
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,140
Amazing! Baron Ragnaki has
divided himself into 4 warriors!

73
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,723
That's Danima's
technique! He stole it, see?

74
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:34,083
That means he turned Danima
into Yaki! He is guilty of everything!

75
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,480
Suddenly the forces
are equal again!

76
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,203
This is getting difficult

77
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,480
I have to stop Sidmodius

78
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,576
Sid-Sen Ira!

79
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Kai of Baron Ragnaki!

80
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,896
It can't be

81
00:12:55,843 --> 00:13:02,336
This is unheard of! I had never seen
a warrior with the Baron's strength
