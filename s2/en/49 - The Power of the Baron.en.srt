1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,777
Incredible!

2
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,300
You've always been
our hakuro, Zack

3
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:49,163
Together, we will
defeat Sidmodius!

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,169
Yeah!

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,700
You see? You
joined me in the end.

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You should be
winning a tournament

7
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,250
Wait!

8
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:29,800
The fury of all those you
have hurt will fall on you today.

9
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,420
The human warriors
have arrived just in time.

10
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Hah! Suck that!

11
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,648
Well, without further delay, let's
start the final of the Grand Tournament.

12
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,740
It's time...

13
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,960
Sendokai!

14
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,080
Ragnaki!

15
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,260
Masara-Sendo-Kayetsu

16
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,520
Let the Sendokai begin!

17
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:14,182
Baron Ragnaki steps
forward and takes the Do

18
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,460
Not so fast...

19
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,360
Nu-Sen Flare!

20
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,180
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

21
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,760
Go-Sen Tornado!

22
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,080
The 2 teams are very even!!!

23
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:15,177
How about we stop warming
up and start fighting seriously?

24
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,950
Baron Ragnaki has fallen!

25
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,575
It seems as if he
has received a blow

26
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,100
Cheating humans!

27
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:49,370
He's faking!

28
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:01,340
I've seen that trick before

29
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,442
He's getting away!

30
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,214
Kiet! Fenzy! Follow him!

31
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,205
Sid-Sen...

32
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,220
Tai-Sen Trail!

33
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,670
The Humans get the Do
and prevent a Kai from Baron!

34
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,040
20, 21, and 22, I'm winning

35
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Ha, I've beaten 23...

36
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,620
But the little one doesn't count

37
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,243
Stop behaving like children. You
look like you are 200 years old!

38
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll have to make it a little
more difficult for them...

39
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,960
What's happening?

40
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,740
Oh, look!

41
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,650
Oh no!

42
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,957
Where did all those
monsters come from?!?

43
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:15,040
How horrible... And
Zack is out there!

44
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,480
We can't find our children. By
any chance, could they be here?

45
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,860
Oh no... They've
done it again...

46
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,155
Look, I told Kiet not to
save the world anymore!

47
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,280
We have to go out
and fight with them!!!

48
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,580
But if we are nothing
more than human,

49
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,540
I refuse to let a pack of monsters take
over our planet without fighting back!

50
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,820
Careful Tanpo! Behind you!

51
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:22,520
Hi, handsome. I thought
you wouldn't come back

52
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,140
Attack!

53
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Sid-Sin...

54
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:52,618
Anger!

55
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,807
Duo-Sen Wall!

56
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,660
Sho-Sen Fire!

57
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,594
Sid-Sen Shied!

58
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,100
It seems that the Baron is having a
hard time Fighting at the level of Humans

59
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,180
Yoohoo! That's how it's done!

60
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes! High five!

61
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,800
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

62
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:08,960
Hmm. Speaking of
Sidmodius, I don't trust him...

63
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Don't you realize?

64
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:17,135
These people don't care about you at all!

65
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,435
They don't deserve your help,
why do you do it? Why do you fight?

66
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,915
For Masara, for The
Earth, and for Danima...

67
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,283
Ah yes, I'm sorry
about the old lady.

68
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:45,856
I shouldn't have stolen so much energy from
her when I transformed her into Yaki...

69
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,200
Wait! If he transformed
her, that means that...

70
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:02,600
Exactly! That I
absorbed her powers!

71
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:08,700
Masara-Sen Fracta!

72
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:21,140
Amazing! Baron Ragnaki has
divided himself into 4 warriors!

73
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:28,723
That's Danima's
technique! He stole it, see?

74
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:34,083
That means he turned Danima
into Yaki! He is guilty of everything!

75
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,480
Suddenly the forces
are equal again!

76
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,203
This is getting difficult

77
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,480
I have to stop Sidmodius

78
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:25,576
Sid-Sen Rage!

79
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Kai for the Baron Ragnaki!

80
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,896
It can't be

81
00:12:55,843 --> 00:13:02,336
This is unheard of! I have never seen
a warrior with the Power of the Baron
