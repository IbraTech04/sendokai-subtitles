00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,640
incredible sendokai music

2
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,300
!!!  You

3
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
You've always been our hakuro, Zack

4
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:49,163
Together, WE WILL DEFEAT SIDMODIUS!!!

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,269
Yes!!

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,700
You see?  You finally joined me.

7
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You should be winning a tournament

8
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,180
Wait!!!!

9
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:29,800
The fury of all those you have hurt will fall on you today.

10
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,420
The human warriors have arrived just in time.

11
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Hah! Suck that one!!!

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,140
Well, without further delay, let's start the final of the Grand Tournament.

13
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,740
It's time...

14
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,960
SENDOKAI!!!!

15
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,080
[Crowd Cheering] 
Ragnaki! Ragnaki! Ragnaki! Ragnaki!

16
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,260
Masara-Sendo-Kayetsu

17
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,520
Let the Sendokai begin!

18
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:13,920
Baron Ragnaki steps forward and takes the Do

19
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,460
Not so fast...

20
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,360
Nu-Sen Flare!

21
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,180
Geo-Sen Shockwave!

22
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,760
Go-Sen Tornado!

23
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
Hey?

24
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,080
The 2 teams are very even!!!

25
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,660
How about we stop warming up and start fighting seriously?

26
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,950
Baron Ragnaki has fallen!

27
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,575
It seems as if he has received a blow

28
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,100
CHEATING Humans!!!

29
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,160
But he is pretending!!!

30
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,340
I already know that trick

31
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,860
EH!  He escaped!

32
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,620
Kiet! Fenzy! Go for it!!!

33
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,205
Sid-Sen...

34
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,220
Tai-Sen Trail!

35
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,100
Hey?

36
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,670
The Humans get The Do and prevent a Kai from Baron!

37
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,040
20, 21, and 22, I'm winning

38
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,800
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, I've beaten 23...

39
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,620
But the little one doesn't count

40
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,243
Stop behaving like children. You look like you are 200 years old!!!

41
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,160
I'll have to make it a little more difficult for them...

42
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,960
What's happening?

43
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Oh, look!

44
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,650
Oh no!

45
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,957
Where did all those monsters come from?!?

46
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:15,040
How horrible... And Zack is out there!

47
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,480
We can't find our children. By any chance, could they be here?

48
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,860
Oh no... They've done it again...

49
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,155
Look, I told Kiet not to save the world anymore!

50
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,280
We have to go out and fight with them!!!

51
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,580
But if we are nothing more than human,

52
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,540
I refuse to let a pack of monsters take over our planet without fighting back!

53
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,820
Careful Tanpo! Behind you!

54
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:22,520
Hi handsome... I thought you wouldn't come back...

55
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,140
To the attack!

56
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Sid-Sin...

57
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,580
Duo-Sen Wall!

58
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,660
Sho-Sen Fire!

59
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,500
Sid-Sen Shild!

60
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,100
It seems that the Baron is having a hard time Fighting at the level of Humans

61
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,180
Yoohoo! That's how it's done!

62
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes! High five!

63
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:03,800
Come on, what are you waiting for?

64
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,960
Hmmm... When it comes to Sidmodius, I wouldn't trust too easily

65
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Don't you realize?

66
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:26,435
These people don't care about you at all! They don't deserve your help, why do you do it?  Why do you fight?

67
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,580
For Masara, for The Earth, and for Danima...

68
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,283
Ahhhh yes... I'm sorry about the old lady.

69
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,856
I shouldn't have stolen so much energy from her when I transformed her into Yaki...

70
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,200
So If he transformed her... That means that...

71
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Exactly! That I absorbed her powers!

72
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:08,700
Masara - SEN - FRACTAAA!!!

73
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,140
Amazing! Baron Ragnaki has divided himself into 4 warriors!

74
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:34,150
That's Danima's technique! He stole it, see?!?  That means he turned Danima into Yaki!!!  He is guilty of everything!

75
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,480
Suddenly the forces are equal again!

76
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,203
This is getting difficult

77
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,480
I have to stop Sidmodius

78
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,576
Sid-Sen Ira!

79
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Kai of Baron Ragnaki!

80
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:49,896
It can't be

81
00:12:55,843 --> 00:13:02,336
This is unheard of! I had never seen a warrior with the Baron's strength
