1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,480
Hello?



2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,000
Miss Chloe, please.



3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,240
Yes, it's me.



4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm calling to make you an offer.



5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,760
Would you like to go
to the movies this afternoon with a Mr. Zack?



6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Of course.



7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,880
I am very interested in this offer.



8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,520
Do you accept? Yes. Perfect.



9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,000
Mr. Zack will be at the
cinema at four o'clock.



10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
Great.



11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,600
But tell Mr. Zack
not to forget this time.



12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,760
I know very well.



13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,440
What do you take me for.



14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,960
Of course I will not forget it.



15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,800
You better hope so.



16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,920
I would not like to end up
end up alone at the cinema door.



17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,680
And 3/4 of an hour.



18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I can't believe it.



19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,240
Yes, it.



20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Chloe.



21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,080
What are you doing here?



22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,480
I just came from buying some discs.



23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
How about you?



24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Did you go to the movies alone?



25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,040
Well, I've come for an offer.



26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,280
You know how those sellers are.



27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,600
He always lies.



28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,080
That record is by Mel B.



29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
Do you know them? I love them.



30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
It is the Red album.



31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
They say he is the best.



32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
Well, I was going home to listen to it.



33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,240
Now.



34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,240
I don't know if you want to come to.



35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,600
Okay.



36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
Why not?



37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I have the afternoon free.



38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,440
In.



39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,000
We have discovered that no



40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is only the Earth in the past.



41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,840
Why are there two models there?



42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
What is Dark Genesis?



43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
The affairs of the multiverse
are no longer my business.



44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
Neither.



45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,920
I am now a simple scribe.



46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Don't pretend it's not with you.



47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,200
If it wasn't for you,
this wouldn't be happening.



48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,120
Do you want to know?



49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,120
All right, I'll tell you.



50
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,760
But only if you defeat me in a match



51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
local.



52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,160
Be careful.



53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,240
When he joined the Thorns,
he became very strong.



54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,360
Relaxed.



55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,960
I also
learned some tricks in the vortex.



56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's go. Neither.



57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
It will do no good to delay your defeat.



58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,520
You're disguised as humble,
but you're still arrogant.



59
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,200
The match, bro,
will still be decided only here.



60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,240
I see. Mi.



61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Watch out. I'm going home.



62
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,400
What about your parents?



63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,720
They are not.



64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,000
My father is out all day.



65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
What about my mother?



66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
Good,



67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,320
my mother.



68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,640
I haven't seen it for years.



69
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,160
They don't get along very well.



70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm sorry about that. It's all right.



71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,480
It was worse when they were together.



72
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
Go.



73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,240
It's all art books and music.



74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes, life sometimes
sometimes is not as we would like it to be, but.



75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,200
These books are always great.



76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I don't know what I would do without them.



77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I know what you mean.



78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Do you also play the piano?



79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, it used to be.



80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,360
I even composed my own songs.



81
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,560
Really?



82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Can you play something you have composed?



83
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
I just quit.



84
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,040
I haven't played for ages.



85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,920
Don't play modest with me.



86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,760
No, please.



87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,400
Let's go. Come on, let's go.



88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Only one song.



89
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Sorry.



90
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,800
What?



91
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's listen to the record.



92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Yes, good idea.



93
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,840
Happy to show singing?



94
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,800
Me. Are you a deaf man?



95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,160
This has nothing to do with the



96
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Soprano.



97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's go.



98
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,600
Saved your life when the flower exploded.



99
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I didn't ask you to save me anymore.



100
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
You should have let me



101
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
there. Now.



102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,320
You know what it's like to live



103
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,320
always in your brother's shadow.



104
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,200
No. Oh, you're the wise one.



105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
The fort.



106
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,840
And everybody admired you.



107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But who was looking at me?



108
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
I admired you. No.



109
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
Do you call love?



110
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,520
Yes, my, my, my, my and my.



111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,600
I have done horrible things.



112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
No one will forgive me.



113
00:08:49,680 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh. Hello, Zack.



114
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
Are you feeling well?



115
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,640
Yeah. I've been helping my dad paint the garage door and, well.
paint the garage door and, well,



116
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,040
the cat has got into the paint



117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,840
and then my face jumped out
and I forgot that it was left.



118
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,600
Is Chloe here?



119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,760
It has not been out for a long time.



120
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay, thank you. Thank you.



121
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Yes. What fun.



122
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Cloe.



123
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,240
Last month.



124
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
Very good. And now.



125
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,080
By the way, this is for you.



126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
What?



127
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,440
I can't.



128
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,680
Of course it is.



129
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,520
I would be very excited. Really?



130
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't know what to say.



131
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you.



132
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
But this way you won't get rid
from teaching me your songs.



133
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Not a chance.



134
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,840
The Dark Genesis.



135
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,000
The dark Genesis
is the origin of the Solar Empire.



136
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,800
It was at Masada millions of years ago.



137
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
The Zor Empire was born on Earth. Yes.



138
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,480
According to legend, Masada
was plunged into chaos



139
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,280
until a leader emerged who was able to unite



140
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,120
all its peoples to the Great Sun.



141
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,560
If you first joined them



142
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
and then enslave them, then.



143
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,720
God has traveled to the past



144
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,840
to join the Great Sun. No.



145
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,000
That vermin
doesn't want to follow anyone's orders.



146
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,800
If he has traveled to the past
it is because without hatred



147
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,160
wants to become the big winner.



148
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,880
The destiny of the multiverse is once again



149
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
once again in the hands of the boys.



150
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,080
God is a manipulator.



151
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,720
It makes people distrust each other.
each other.



152
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
The warriors will have
to be a very strong team.



153
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,040
Fortunately, my guys are a



154
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:42,840
unbreakable equipment. Y.
