1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,480
Hello?

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,000
Miss Chloe, please.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,240
Yes, it's me.

4
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm calling to make you an offer.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,760
Would you like to go
to the movies this afternoon with a Mr. Zack?

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Of course.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,880
I am very interested in this offer.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,153
I accept, yes

9
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:03,095
Pefect. Mr. Zack will be at
the cinema at four o'clock.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
Great.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,295
But tell Mr. Zack
not to forget this time.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,606
I know him very well

13
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:15,887
What do you take me for.
Of course I will not forget it.

14
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:17,800
You better hope so.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,920
I would not like to end up
end up alone at the cinema door.

16
00:01:23,465 --> 00:01:25,895
45 minutes!

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,028
I can't believe it.

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,864
Hey, Lon!

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Chloe.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,934
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,760
I just came from buying some discs.
How about you?

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,815
Did you go to the movies alone?

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,040
Well, I've come for an offer.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,600
You know how those sellers are.
He always lies.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,080
That record is by Mel B.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,965
Do you know them?

27
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,280
I love them!
It is the Red album?

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
They say it's the best.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,317
Well, I was going home to listen to it now
I don't know if you want to come to.

30
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,919
Okay.
Why not?

31
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:19,317
I have the afternoon free.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,395
Kento.

33
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,000
We have discovered that
Masara is Earth in the past.

34
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,840
Why are Sidmodius there?

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
What is Dark Genesis?

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,280
The affairs of the multiverse
are no longer my business, Tanpo

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,920
I am now a simple scribe.

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,208
Don't pretend it's not with you.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,200
If it wasn't for you,
this wouldn't be happening.

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Do you want to know?
All right, I'll tell you.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,994
But only if you defeat
me in a Sendokai match.

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,160
Be careful.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,240
When he joined the Zorn,
he became very strong.

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,535
Relax. I also learned
some tricks in the vortex.

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,520
Let's go, Tanpo!

46
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 It will do no good to delay your defeat!

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,520
You're disguised as humble,
but you're still arrogant.

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,200
The match, brother, will
be decided with one Kai

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wow, nice place!

50
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,695
And your parents aren't home?

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,000
My father is out all day.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
And my mother...

53
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
Well...

54
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:56,640
I haven't seen my mother in years

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,160
They don't get along very well.

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,409
I'm sorry about that.

57
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:02,245
It's all right.
It was worse when they were together.

58
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,240
It's all art books and music.

59
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes, sometimes life is not
as we would like it to be, but...

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,768
These books are always great.
I don't know what I would do without them.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,190
I know what you mean.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
Do you also play the piano?

63
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Well, I used to. I even
composed my own songs.

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,893
Really?

65
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Can you play something you have composed?

66
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,040
I stopped. I haven't
played for ages.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,920
Don't play modest with me.

68
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,760
No, please.

69
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,737
Let's go.

70
00:05:51,762 --> 00:05:54,104
Come on! Only one song!

71
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:58,127
Sorry.

72
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's listen to the record.

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Yes, good idea.

74
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,800
What are you trying to prove,
Kento? You're no longer a Zorn!

75
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,959
This has nothing to do with the Zorn

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,928
Cron-Sen Shadow!

77
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,215
I Saved your life when
the Zorn ship exploded

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,655
I didn't ask you to
save me!

79
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,399
You should have
let me stay there!

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,972
Do you know what it's like to live
always in your brother's shadow?

81
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:46,200
You're the wise one.

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
The strong one

83
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:56,506
And everybody admired you.
But who was looking at me?

84
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,258
I admired you

85
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,495
Vortex- Sen Fire!

86
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,149
Yes!

87
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:39,600
I have done horrible things.

88
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,957
No one will forgive me.

89
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,760
Hello Zak! Are you okay?

90
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,615
Yeah. I've been helping my dad
paint the garage door and, well.

91
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,318
the cat got into the
paint and then jumped

92
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:22,335
on my face and I
forgot that it was there

93
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,598
Is Cloe here?

94
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,855
No, she hasn't been home for a while

95
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,780
 Okay, thank you

96
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:36,815
How fun!

97
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,213
Cloe!

98
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,381
I really enjoyed that

99
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:46,695
Me too

100
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,080
By the way, this is for you.

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
What?

102
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,280
I can't-

103
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,127
Of course you can
I would be very excited.

104
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,496
Really!

105
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,840
I don't know what to say.

106
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Thank you.

107
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
But that won't get you out
of teaching me your songs.

108
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,751
Not a chance.

109
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,840
The Dark Genesis.

110
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,895
The Dark Genesis
is the origin of the Solar Empire.

111
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,800
It was in Masara millions of years ago.

112
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,983
The Zorn Empire was born on Earth?

113
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:27,872
Yes.

114
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,428
According to legend,
Masara was plunged into

115
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:42,120
chaos until a leader emerged who was able
to unite all its people. The Great Zorn

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,735
Yes. He first united them.

117
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,070
And then enslave them.

118
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:56,336
Then Sidmodius has traveled to
the past to join the Great Zorn

119
00:10:56,361 --> 00:11:01,375
No. That vermin doesn't
want to follow anyone's orders.

120
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,800
If he has traveled to the past
it is because Sidmodius

121
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:09,759
wants to become The Great Zorn

122
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,074
The destiny of the multiverse is once again
once again in the hands of the Sen-Kuns

123
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,080
Sidmodius is a manipulator.

124
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,415
He makes people distrust each other.
each other.

125
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,600
The warriors will have
to be a very strong team.

126
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Fortunately, my guys
are an unbreakable team
