1
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,791
All my life I have been a subject.

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,463
I have always been on my knees.

3
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:55,920
But when I become The Great Zorn, it
will be the others who kneel before me!

4
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,565
We will provoke the Dark Genesis.

5
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,760
And very soon you will be the great one.

6
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:05,760
But you must get
even stronger first.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,840
And I guess that's
what we're here

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,080
Where else will you find more
energy than in the city of the <i>Kredlers</i>?

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,720
You've learned the Duo-Sen
Force, an attack power.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,000
And the Duo-Sen Wall, a defensive power.

11
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:40,360
But we still need to learn a power
of agility: The Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,120
Cloe, you are the
right warrior for it.

13
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:52,654
And you must be accompanied by the
warrior with which you are more attuned.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,315
Who is it?

15
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,049
Me! Me!

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,096
Isn't it obvious? Clay and
I have a special chemistry!

17
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,158
I guess... Zak

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
Good.

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,713
We will enjoy a combat to learn how
to master the Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt

20
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:27,000
Against who? Are you going
to bring hamsters with tanks?

21
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:32,236
No, you will fight me.

22
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,104
Sen-Do-Kai!

23
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,252
Masara-Sen Fracta!

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm still not used to these things.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Relax, it happens
to all beginners.

26
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,680
Let the Sendokai begin!

27
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:25,174
Quickly, Kiet!

28
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,877
Duo-Sen Wall!

29
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,947
Yes!

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,260
I got it!

31
00:03:57,752 --> 00:03:58,830
A rookie.

32
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,908
Zet-Sen Shot!

33
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
How?

34
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you do it?

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
That's my power.

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,280
I don't know. It just... did

37
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,535
When you used the
Duo-Sen Force with Zak

38
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,936
Your energies merged, and
you have now acquired his knowledge.

39
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,515
Great. Attacked by
a team of geraniums.

40
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,007
Guys.
Watch out!

41
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:14,038
Cloe! We have to
activate the Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt

42
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,663
Duo-Sen-

43
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
What went wrong?

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe we are not
as close as we thought we were.

45
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:56,827
No!

46
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,936
And to have choose me!

47
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,160
Do you want see a real
real Zet-Sen Shot?

48
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,124
What's he talking about?

49
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,054
Look.
Backwards!

50
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,480
Zet-Sen Shot...

51
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,720
Damn it!

52
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:00,640
Hey, buddy! You've
really outdone yourself

53
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:21,864
Cloe!

54
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,483
How about we try to activate the
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt?

55
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,765
What? What about Zak?

56
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,186
It's the only way to
win the Sendokai!

57
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,585
Alright

58
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,804
Cloe!

59
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,046
Now!

60
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,796
Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

61
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,080
I got it! I got it!

62
00:08:56,992 --> 00:08:58,158
Yes!

63
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:03,216
Kai...?

64
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,205
I scored a Kai!

65
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,455
Watch out!

66
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
The queen of vegetables strikes back!

67
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,697
Danima!

68
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,360
Sorceress! How do you feel?

69
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Something terrible is happening.

70
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:45,295
Sidmodius has attacked
the city of the Kredlers!

71
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
He has absorbed too much energy.

72
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
He is merciless.

73
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
This does not look good.

74
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,360
If something bad happens to
her, how do we stop Sidmodius?

75
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
Relax.

76
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
At least we have
activated all the powers.

77
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
Yes, you activated mine!

78
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Hey! Powers belong to those who know how to
use them.

79
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,320
I know what you are doing.

80
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,600
You stole my Zet-Sen Shot!

81
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,200
You stole my Duo-Sen Lightning Bolt!

82
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,986
And now you're going to steal-

83
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,244
Guys!

84
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,775
Danima is going to die.

85
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Not if we can stop it!

86
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,960
We have to find Sidmodius now
and destroy Sestrad's chest!

87
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Let's give that leech what he deserves!

88
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,033
Kido.
Stay here with Danima!

89
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,853
Everyone else, follow me!

90
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm ready to become the Great Zorn!

91
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,228
Still.

92
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Why not?

93
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Remember the words written
in the Dark Genesis?

94
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,000
To be The Great Zorn, it is not
enough to have an army and be strong.

95
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:51,480
You have to be a leader. And a leader needs
a people to follow him unconditionally.

96
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
And how am I going to get that?

97
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
How The Great Zorn did it!

98
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,220
Winning the First Great
Sendokai Tournamnet!
