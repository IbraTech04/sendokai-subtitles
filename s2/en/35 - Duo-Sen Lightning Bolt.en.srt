1
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,640
All my life I have been a subject.



2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,320
I have always been on my knees.



3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,840
But when I become the Great Sun,



4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
it will be the others
who kneel before me.



5
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,480
We will provoke the dark Genesis.



6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,760
And very soon you will be the great one.



7
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
But it must be even stronger first.



8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,200
And I guess by.



9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
That's what we are here.



10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Where else will you find more energy



11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,080
than in the city of make-believe.



12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
And in the force.



13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
An attack power.



14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,000
And the wall in a defensive power.



15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
But we still need to wake up.



16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
A power of agility.



17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,360
The lightning strikes us



18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,360
spoke.



19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,120
You are the right warrior for it.



20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,600
And you must be accompanied by the warrior



21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
with which you are more attuned.



22
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Who is it?



23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,400
Me. Me.



24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,480
Is it clear?



25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,480
Clay and I have a special chemistry.



26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,440
I guess.



27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
Good.



28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,320
We will enjoy a combat
to learn how to master the Lightning.



29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,720
Thirsty? White. And against whom?



30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you going to
are you going to bring hamsters with tanks?



31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,480
You will not fight me.



32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,520
Good.



33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,760
I have one.



34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Launch!



35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Matt Saracen attacks.



36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm still not used to these things.



37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Calm down.



38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
It happens to all beginners.



39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,680
Let the second Kg begin.



40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Already ha.



41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,720
Quickly!



42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:36,800
Who?



43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,280
I go. By.



44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
The least.



45
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,760
A rookie.



46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Shot. Yes.



47
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:22,640
There is. There is.



48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
How?



49
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you do it?



50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
That's my power.



51
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,280
I don't know. It came out like this.



52
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,760
When you made the strength. You.



53
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Find you.



54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Your energies have united
and you have already acquired



55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
your knowledge.



56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,000
And address.



57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Therefore.



58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Great.



59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Attacked by a team of geraniums.



60
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,640
Guys.



61
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,560
Watch out!



62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,440
We have to release the lightning.



63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Not you.



64
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
The lightning.



65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:39,280
You. Us.



66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
What went wrong?



67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe we are not
as close as we thought we were.



68
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Now. No.



69
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,360
And to have chosen me. Da.



70
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,160
Do you want



71
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,160
see how the real shot is made?



72
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Come on, Cole, he's bitten.



73
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
Look.



74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,480
Back to back. A.



75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,480
Shot. Se.



76
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Ha. Damn it!



77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,080
Hello, colleague.



78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,640
You have covered yourself with glory.



79
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Oh, no.



80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
And Briggs was dying.



81
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,600
What do you think about



82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,880
if we try to awaken the Lightning
sweet in us?



83
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,080
But it's the only way
to win field hockey.



84
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,640
It's ok yes.



85
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Cloe.



86
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Now.



87
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
No. Use the.



88
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,920
Got it.



89
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Got it.



90
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,920
Yes, Kaji,



91
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I have marked a.



92
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,880
Parrot!



93
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,480
Guys.



94
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
The queen of vegetables strikes back.



95
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
We have.



96
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,840
To Priestess.



97
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,360
How do you feel?



98
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Something terrible is happening.



99
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Morbius has attacked the city.



100
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
It has absorbed too much energy.



101
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
No mercy.



102
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Y. Oh. Oh!



103
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
This does not look good.



104
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,360
Good.



105
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,920
If something bad happens to you.



106
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,360
How do we stop your God?



107
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
Relax.



108
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
At least we have awakened all the
powers.



109
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
If you have awakened mine.



110
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Hey, powers belong to those who know how to
use them.



111
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,320
I know what you are doing.



112
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,600
You took the shot away from me.



113
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,200
You took my lightning away. Your voice.



114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,760
And now you want to take me away?



115
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
If you take.



116
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
Anima is going to die.



117
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Not if we can stop it.



118
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,160
We have to find Sid



119
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,960
and destroy the disaster box.



120
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Let's give her what she deserves
to that leech.



121
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Kido.



122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Stay here with Danny.



123
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
Others.



124
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Follow me.



125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm ready to do the big favor.



126
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Still.



127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,200
Why not?



128
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
Remember the words written
in the Dark Genesis.



129
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,160
To be the big tournament.



130
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
It is not enough to have an army
and be strong.



131
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
You have to be a leader.



132
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,480
And a leader needs a people



133
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
to follow him unconditionally.



134
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,880
And how am I going to get that?



135
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
How the Big Tower did it



136
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,960
being the winner of the first major tournament of.
