# Resources 

To ensure consistency between the subtitles and the original content, we have setup this folder as a resources sub-repository. This folder contains all the resources you need to subtitle the episodes, including:

- [Spelling of names and terms used in the series](./dictionary)
- Character names and their respective spellings
- Subtitling guidelines and tips (coming soon)
